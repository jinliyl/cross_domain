1	al gore is just pissed obama did n't force every company into the chicago climate exchange , which he co founded and co owned , so he would be a billionaire by now
2	it 's so clear now that i see all the evidence in one place you 're a moron
6	you mean a tea party blog said some thing stupid ?
2	stop exploiting dead soldiers for karma , galt
6	expect more it is the fighting season
2	he 's also an angry , abusive little asshole who tries to intimidate guests and refuses to let people with strong contradictory positions to voice them properly
4	sometimes tds makes cuts , but i 've never heard anyone , left or right , say they were edited poorly on the daily show i honestly think tds has higher journalistic standards than most ( if not all ) ' legitimate , ' news outlets
2	i'm sorry , but i really am not surprised considering the statements he used to start the interview do n't get me wrong i totally agree with you all and this is first time i 've ever seen an interview with this guy he was rude from the start and made it hard to watch with out wanting to nerf bat the guy to unconsciousness
3	take it easy , guys this guy is very angry
1	again , you avoid the difference between bias and activism and distortion strawman this is not a matter of liberal v conservative , though that meme is handy for arguments as specious as yours it 's reality v distortions
6	do you have webbed feet ?
6	you do n't like the idea of pulling our troops out of afghanistan or decriminalizing marijuana on the federal level ? those are two of ron paul 's political positions that chris wallace has used to paint him negatively
1	damn , and after all that respect stewart was giving him on his own show i guess he was wrong to give him the benefit of the doubt
4	wait for the ending haha
5	sad but hardly surprising fox is n't even a news station , it 's just a large propaganda machine
1	i love that the guy who called a team of black women " nappy headed hoes " is making a racial issue out of jon stewart mocking herman cain with a cartoonish voice nobody but the writers at fox news even perceived that in a racial way , and that speaks volumes about how seriously these idiots take a black candidate as if to say he 's not a politician with a voice , he 's a black politician with a black voice bitch please , get over it and what 's with conservatives ' love of the victim role ? i swear , i ca n't remember the last time i heard palin , beck , or anyone else at fox talk for more than five minutes without looking for a shoulder to cry on in response to this cruel , harsh world they face again bitch please
6	does no one else love that imus brought up jon stewart 's " amos and andy " voice , and how no one else could get away with it ?
2	show of hands who expected more of fox ?
1	he does n't want to do that ideologically , he does n't see a need for these things but realistically he does the only difference is that ron paul wants to pay for these things with money that is not printed out of thin air or borrowed from foreign nations ron paul proposes increasing funding to social security , medicare , welfare , foodstamps , all domestic social programs he just wants to pay for them with real money and not debt to do this , you stop sending out billions in foreign aid and you stop global wars of occupation ron paul also wants to eliminate taxing social security , welfare , unemployment as though it was income particularly in the case of social security , people already paid tax on that money when they were young , why are they paying a double tax on their savings ? i hope this cleared some things up for you
2	they edit it so they 'll get traffic on their website
1	" it was still <> minutes , which was longer than we had intended , and if you want to watch the full interview , though i can t imagine why anyone would " yeah , who the fuck wants to watch chris wallace on fox news interview anything
2	why does jon go on fox ? he should insist they air the interview live or not edit it
1	has there ever been major fallout from a news organization pulling the same kind of propaganda shit ( or worse ) that fox does ?
4	happy bireddithday !
1	this is true i have conservative ' friends ' that call facts a left point of view , when all they are are facts stewart does bring a little bit of a liberal slant , but yes he does seem to be more logical than trying to push an agenda he wants to call them on their bull shit which needs to happen
8	while he may not be a " ideological , partisan activist " , the man does have ideas ideas that are larger than just poking fun at cable news because its an easy target remember the crossfire interview ? i do n't think he did that for ratings or to gain credibility
2	because they always manage to prove his point even as they do everything possible to prevent that
8	he goes on to face them instead of hiding away like glen beck does it helps show he stands by what he believes and is open to being challenged
4	in a bashing of what you consider biased media , you took us to a site whose tacking is " real liberal media " good job suitable fair and balanced , my ass ! an unbridled look at the bizarre reality of fox news ( http www amazon com gp product <> ? ie utf8 & tag idenprop <> & linkcode xm2 & camp <> & creativeasin <> )
6	how do i get a slice of that tasty cake ?
5	the only response to that maddening crap re " i'm entitled to my opinion " is " you are entitled to your own opinion but not to your own facts " ca n't remember who said that now the good news is one of the latest polls showed americans trusting fox less and watching more pbs news i ca n't believe how long it takes us to wake up sometimes
8	this this kind of passive aggressive and underhanded bullshit that keeps me from ever completely respecting wallace
1	good regurgitation ! but i disagree !
1	again , the issue is not bias , it is distortion the two are not necessarily equivalent
2	my argument is that aligning yourself with any party is a waste of time and that it distracts from learning about the individual candidates for office but feel free to continue
5	i agree with you completely in principle i just get tired of the outrage " fox news lied ! " yeah , i know they know too everyone with a brain knows the thing is , the people who believe their lies are not , i guarantee you , logging on to reddit for an intelligent discussion
2	you do realize it is a comedy show vs what calls itself a " news " network ? i mean the station is called comedy central
2	it 's extremely snide and prejudiced and frankly , expressing such a harsh opinion is beneath the profession of a journalist but we all know if you work for fox news you 're a fucking tool
8	it 's not a personal issue though there 's a whole other world of thought that 's completely independent from me and i think it 's arrogant to assume it 'll collapse if you ignore it those people have their own motivations , they fund themselves , and some of them are friends , family , and coworkers ignoring it may change the tone of reddit , but it does n't fix the problem posting on reddit might not seem like an effective solution to you , but i get a lot out of the debates people make on these boards it 's extremely difficult to talk about politics offline because both parties generally have the ability to poorly reference a much larger store of information than they really understand ( the collection of sites or shows they visit watch ) when i read the debates on here the odds of having been exposed to the information they 're referencing or viewpoints they 're presenting is much greater , and it 's helped me reason with people and move conversations that would have dead ended forwards
6	seriously ? they put out the entire palin interview and she looked worse than she did in the edited that said , her interview was not edited to distort her answers were n't taken out of context she looked bad because she thought healthcare was part of the bailout ( that she supported , by the way ) she looked bad because she could n't answer what she read she looked bad because she got tripped up when asked what she did that day you do n't think anyone on reddit is honest ? not even one person ? wow
6	not exactly i do n't watch jon stewart or chris wallace or any other tv really , for that matter is there anything else you 'd like to assume about me ?
4	actually , the way i see it , his smirk is more of a " i'm getting paid to be an asshole " kind of smirk he can be as stupid or as smart as he likes , be as mean or as nice as he likes he knows that in the end , after editing is all done , he will look like the calm smart guy while anyone else will look the fool
5	i hate the way he talks to ron paul he is responsible for spinning ron paul 's positions into a negative light
2	fox news disgusts me
2	wallace is such a smug prick
1	the imus reference did n't tell you that ? did you read it ? plus , duh , you moron , i'm not criticizing the facts , but seriously , how can everyone fucking complain about fox when this kinda shit happens here everyday just goes to show that reddit does n't really give a fuck about objectivity unscrupulous
4	i believe that fox news sunday contains about <> <> minutes of content without commercials the unedited interview is <> minutes long that 's half of their news program in a week when more actual news happened and they had more interviews and panels to conduct one should note that jon stewart has taken to doing the exact same thing all the time now his interviews go long , he airs part of them on the show ( the show only has <> minutes ) and then tells viewers to watch the rest on the web although he just airs the first <> <> minutes and does n't edit it , which is still a pretty big difference
8	perhaps i phrased myself poorly what i mean is that they deliberately edited specific parts of the conversation to misrepresent what stewart had to say , while claiming in the same interview that they 're fair and balanced they did n't need to keep the entire thing for jon 's points to be properly represented , but they do n't want that proper representation
2	yeah , i see what you 're saying , but do n't you think he undermines his message to some degree because fox does edit him ?
4	besides , the full interview is always put on the daily show 's website stewart even reminds people about it when it 's obvious an interview they 're doing will be too long to completely air
2	the only difference between fox news and the daily show is that they 're both selling ad time
8	i'm aware of how post production works you ca n't use everything you shoot , even if it 's all good and you want to how they edit it is the problem it 's that
4	in a bashing of what you consider biased media , you took us to a site whose tacking is " real liberal media " good job
2	the fox news organization is trolls working for posers the only way they can handle the truth is to bury it
2	stewart should return the favor in kind a whole episode filled with edited clips of the fox cronies so they can see what its like to be edited in such a way that makes them even bigger assholes than they already are i'm talking completely obscene edits , from different interviews and time periods , strung together so that you have glenn beck saying , " i'm a huge dick " or megyn kelly saying , " my crabs are worst case ever seen in the united states "
4	wow jon stewart is something
8	it 's not exactly a big shocker that fox news edits interviews in a way that make their people look good and promotes their greater agenda but i think there are few things being brushed over here most edits are made for time considerations and not because of some underhanded desire to silence the voice of opposition most of what fox cut out was inaudable rabbling between stewart and wallace that , quite frankly , needs done more often on fox news the daily show is the king of editing interviews to promote a specific view on things every single segment on that show is edited for a laugh at the expense of someone they 're interviewing agenda driven or not , stewart has very little ground to stand on when it comes to arguing that he was unfairly censored when his show is doing the exact same thing if editing for comedic value is n't promoting a degree of the sensationalism stewart complains about , then i do n't know what is that being said , stewart and the daily show seem to try harder to let their guests speak during the actual " live " interview on the show and make it known that the full interviews can be seen online immediately fox , in my opinion , does not do this tl dr fox news , though obviously biased , may have had legitimate reasons for editing the interview stewart complaining about this is like the pot calling the kettle black
6	when you all say jon stewart , you mean his writers , right ?
8	as an long time film and video editor i can see what he means sometimes their is a great take you just have to cut down to meet time and sometimes because you want to put so much into the piece you are left with cuts that are less then what you wanted that 's not saying that the editor was n't subconsciously biased , it happens all the time for example , why most doctors in movies are male and nurses are female , the director or casting agent did n't even think about it , its just how they saw it in their head
8	because he believes in being civil , which means talking to people you disagree with
4	agreed
2	i'm sure they have some kind of implicit reciprocity agreement stewart probably wants the fox people to come on his show where he can corner them and or boost his ratings
8	do n't watch them harder
8	i think that so many people vehemently disagree with stewart ( and others like him ) that having him on their show is a ratings boost simply because " those " people expect to see stewart trounced in a debate regardless of the outcome of the debate , " those " people will feel fox news will have " won " possibly also lends to the credence of their " fair and balanced " tagline
4	the godawful shit eating grin on his face when he tries to condescend to stewart makes my stomach churn
4	i believe that fox news sunday contains about <> <> minutes of content without commercials the unedited interview is <> minutes long that 's half of their news program in a week when more actual news happened and they had more interviews and panels to conduct do n't get me wrong , i fucking hate the shit out of fox news too , but this is a very simplistic way of thinking the issue was n't that they edited the interview at all , it 's how it was edited namely , they cut out the <> second reference about how fox news receives " marching orders " , giving jon no context and making him look more like a loony than a reasoned person much like how you appear like a loony for insisting the only reason the program would have to edit an interview was to effect a different opinion , rather than to cut down on time
8	zero news organizations would have aired it in full whether this excuses fox or indicts the media i leave to you
1	damn stewart he worded things so well that they were having issues even making him look bad , but themselves instead does n't he know he 's supposed to hand them material that they can work with to push their pov ? )
1	he 's also an angry , abusive little asshole who tries to intimidate guests and refuses to let people with strong contradictory positions to voice them properly
2	what does fox get out of having stewart on any of their shows ? do they actually think they come away looking like the winner anytime he does an interview with them ?
4	i actually think his greatest coup here was against huffpo
1	he 's also an angry , abusive little asshole who tries to intimidate guests and refuses to let people with strong contradictory positions to voice them properly
8	i agree with your point , but i do n't think he is bringing a left sided pov , but rather a reality based pov it 's interesting that we all now assume that left reality since right fox too often distortions to clarify , i did n't hear him advocating for left policies or ideology he seems to care more about being reasonable than being left he brought up the fox emails that prove that they have marching orders and agendas for their lineup , and that is what they edited out
6	but does he really if he gets edited ?
6	the jon stewart interviews at cnn or fox have been more about criticism of news coverage and less about particular political positions he had his beef with cnn on the cross talk debates about the legitimacy of the debate show in the same vain , he has asked fox to admit they are pushing an agenda rather than call themselves " fair and balanced " i am not sure what is left or right about his main criticisms in these cases
8	wallace says he was n't witty enough to challenge jon stewart on comparing himself ( jon ) to murrow or twain but that 's completely irrelevant because jon specifically said at his " highest aspiration " and he no doubt used that phrase for the specific reason that he did n't want to compare himself to either
6	" they 're not ill informed ? "
1	and chris wallace still has n't been waterboarded for charity since he raped and killed that girl in <> !
2	fox is for cowards
6	til chris wallace is mike wallace 's son how did i not know this before ?
2	yes , because if your point takes more than two minutes to explain , you 're ' filibustering '
6	anyone have a link to the email he was talking about ? i 'd very much like to read it
6	imus is still on tv ? figures fox would give that racist prick a home really goes to show you what their demographic is
6	i know this has nothing to do with the editing , but does anyone else have a problem with both chris wallace and don imus bringing issue to jon 's portrayal of herman cain with his " amos and andy " voice i mean for don imus ( of the famous " nappy headed hoes " comment ) its an astonishing level of hypocrisy , but even for wallace its strange that he brings up this point when he works for a network that once ran with headlines such as " outraged liberals stop picking on obama 's baby mama ! " i just do n't think anyone on fox news can play the race card after obama
2	ron paul 's policy ideas are responsible for putting ron paul in a bad light
2	i think it 's more of an " i only have this job because of my dad and stepfather " type of smirk
6	do n't get me wrong , i love marijuana and hate wars as much as the next responsible young adult , but there 's more to ron paul then that some of it is pretty quirky does n't he have a gold fetish ?
2	you do n't like the idea of pulling our troops out of afghanistan or decriminalizing marijuana on the federal level ? and he likes puppies and kittens but he still wants to get rid of the safety nets , social security and such , so i do n't like him
8	yeah , it 's not like game of thrones is popular or anything um , i mean the king in the north !
6	dude , that was going to be my guess ! also , what do you do when you have to go real bad ? are they quick release laces ?
2	your friend is retarde oh wait you did say he was a conservative
2	exactly , all news organizations need to be called out on it if we did n't live in dumbfuckistan we could have news on the shows like cnn instead of celebrity gossip go back to having the actual news and not leaning one way or the other i do n't understand what is so damn hard about that and it really is disgusting when you 're debating with someone and even after you present facts they 're just like " that is your opinion and i have mine , not going to change it " are n't we suppose to base our opinions on facts not what the bible says or what ever fear story they read edit added second paragraph
2	your friend is retarde oh wait you did say he was a conservative
4	i love watching bill and jon interview each other you can see a great deal of respect between the two they both have very different points of view and have great discussions when on each others shows
8	yeah , over all o ' reilly is n't bad but sometimes he is just over the top and crazy , but only part of fox news i respect ( just a little )
1	chris wallace is a smarmy lookin asshole he 's the kind of person i just want to hit whenever i see him smirk and i'm not even a violent guy it 's just that his face expresses " i'm just being an asshole because i like being an asshole " and that attitude is exactly what he 's doing with jon stewart fuck you , chris wallace
1	by repeating the same claim after the interview where jon refuted that suggestion , is n't wallace proving jon 's point ? i mean , maybe the chris wallace on talk radio is n't the same chris wallace on fox news , and does n't have to adhere to the same journalistic integrity it 's a blatant omission from the conversation , and harms the public by willfully ignoring what transpired
8	the catch to all of this is remembering who the audience is most of the people watching fox are not tech savvy to say the least this is how they will demonize stewart for being on their station edit it down for grandma and then post the full version online so they can claim no responsibility for having to edit down interviews they intentionally let it run long so they can butcher it up , get him as tired and flustered as possible and then for the curious conservative with a computer , they remind you that you 've already seen everything there is to see pay no attention to the man behind the curtain
1	he 's the kind of person i just want to hit whenever i see him smirk and i'm not even a violent guy you sound more like a jon stewart watching type of person , and you appear to be pretty clear on the marching orders he 's given you
1	that surprised me as a remarkably low and rude thing to say why would you say that about your own interview with your own guest ? not to mention one that was very interesting ?
6	what a dick wow
1	poor liberals got <> minutes of stewart instead of <> how will you ever live ? i'm curious , how many of you laughed at palin when she complained about having her interview edited , but now are upset that jon was edited ? anyone ? anyone honest here on reddit ?
8	i know you all can ' t wait to suck jon stewart ' s dick but the daily show is propaganda just like fox news deal with it
3	hmm i wonder if there 's a single conservative on reddit
8	chris wallace misrepresented jon stewart again he said in this interview that stewart claimed that he was " just a comedian " jon stewart actually corrected this very exaggeration of chris wallace during the interview he said he was n't and never had said he was " only a comedian "
2	okay , i already do n't watch fox i guess i wo n't watch them even more now
8	ouch re reading it , i 'd have to agree
2	i was recently presented with some crappy letter to the editor from a right wing paper that was decrying seal team <> for not including any long list of minority groups here in their team at first , i was incredulous that someone took this position but the list included fat people and handicapped people i looked at my friend that presented this and said " okay , clearly a joke i was worried for a moment ! " he shook it under my nose and told me " why do you think it 's a joke ? those are your people that 's what you believe ! " sometimes the conversations are n't worth having
8	o ' reilly always insists that the full unedited interviews be posted online , and he mentions this several times he 's just about the only person on fox news who is resonably fair ( but still unbalanced as he admittedly leans to the right )
2	i was recently presented with some crappy letter to the editor from a right wing paper that was decrying seal team <> for not including any long list of minority groups here in their team at first , i was incredulous that someone took this position but the list included fat people and handicapped people i looked at my friend that presented this and said " okay , clearly a joke i was worried for a moment !

8	could n't agree more they need to be called out on distortions it 's the calling facts " liberal " that just sends me over the moon and we 've all started to accept the premise that there are <> sides to reality and there are not <> sides this is how they get away with selling evolution is a theory it boggles the mind when they equate their opinion with expert knowledge and expect it to be taken as <> sides
5	i mean i would argue that life does have a liberal bias
5	either this is a really obscure song of ice and fire reference or i need to stop assuming everything has to do with what i am currently reading
2	i have very little interest in gop democrat politics the point was that credibility goes down when you link to a site that will , as an opponent , try to make the other side look bad
2	i have very little interest in gop democrat politics the point was that credibility goes down when you link to a site that will , as an opponent , try to make the other side look bad
8	that 's a nice strawman , but bias is not the same thing as having an activist agenda or distorting the truth , which is part of stewart 's point on fox , they claim to be fair and balanced while serving as activists for the gop they donate millions to the rga ( and do not disclose this ) and have every republican <> candidate on as contributors , hosts and analysts save ron paul they also allowed candidates to fund raise on the air during <> elections name another network that has done that why do n't you specify a criticism of the article rather than claiming it 's biased
1	your comment reads exactly like all of the digg patriot comments on digg re politicususa articles not saying you are one , but you should try coming up with a criticism of the facts did you even read the article ?
8	i do n't know that it 's hypocritical for a comedian to edit an interview in pursuit of comedy while being upset that a news program ( especially a " fair and balanced " one ) edited an interview to portray him or his apparent political position in a negative light i agree with you that many of the edits were probably motivated by time rather than ideological concerns , but it does appear , to me at least , that some of them were done due to ideology for that smaller portion , i think stewart certainly has adequate grounds on which to cry " foul " e missing parentheses
5	you 're not alone i was surprised , too i guess the apple has fallen far from the tree
2	wallace has the red ass because he was outdone by a guy who did nothing more than speak the truth he admitted he has a liberal slant he admitted he 's a comedian on a network that sometimes does lowbrow comedy he admitted he 's sometimes been out of line in calling conservatives " racist " he admitted his schtick is not new he even pointed out faux 's viewers are the most consistently uninformed people that watch cable news wallace could n't win a battle of wits with a guy that left his in the car goodness , he 's a douche
8	faux news is utter shite , but you 're really attacking them over what is actually an industry wide practice tds and colbert even cut up interviews how they edit it is the problem
5	but it is worth the effort they spread misinformation to a huge audience , and even some on reddit may not realize it any news organization should pride themselves on informing its viewers in an unbiased and truthful way when they mascarade themselves as being unbiased and truthful and then in fact lie or skew facts , the public should be made aware it hurts the public to be lied to by such a large media corporation with as much influence as they have
2	feel free to make a coherent defense in their absence
2	you know , every time fox news does something biased and unethical , every time they spread some blatant lie , everyone gets all up in arms until it dawns on them that this is what fox does ! yes , they have an agenda yes they are deceptive and manipulative try to get over it for more than one day and just ignore them they are n't worth the effort
2	this was begging for a " eh distorts facts and does n't afraid of anything "
6	where does it say the other american was a mercenary ?

2	lol what a schmuck , these republicans have no shame
6	wait did i just watch a fucking interview on fox that had salient points in it ?
2	i hate when politicians call it an entitlement program we pay into social security , and we pay taxes to pay for these programs they are services that we the tax payer fund , and most of them ca n't understand that
6	if social security were funded through direct payments that funded a combination disability insurance and retirement annuity , that would be one thing but , my understanding is that that 's not the way it works are you saying that the social security payments that come out of our paychecks ( along with the employer contribution ) covers the program entirely ?

2	when i voted it was <> no <> yes and <> for medical only totalling <> ? that makes no sense at all , even with ' rounding '
1	" should marijuana ever be legal ? " ? ? ? ? it 's already been legal nice question bias thrown in there
4	this is something all real conservatives and liberals can agree upon !
2	haha i clicked yes , saw the bar go up to <> yes , and then immediately it disappeared and said this poll is currenly unavailable please check back again later
6	not sure why you got downvoted this issue is apparently like religion to those who wish it to stay illegal
4	nah man he must be drunk i 've coded stoned before and got an a for it in uni
2	proof they are rigging the results http i imgur com pljsw png
1	why would they even bother having a poll ? what in the hell is the use ? they 're just going to come around again and say something stupid like " oh well i do n't know what kinda viewers we have on the internet , but " if you 're gonna have a poll , do n't ignore the results just because you do n't think its appropriate
8	well at least bipartisanship exists somewhere
4	he he <> yes
2	heroin , coke , and meth should be legal and sold in liquor stores to anyone over the age of <>
5	i yes 'd that poll so hard
4	thank you for a proper headline
6	what is the h r ? i ca n't find anything except for that h r <> introduced back in may <> <> by barney frank , but not wtih ron paul
2	there 's a rumour floating around that it 's just been rigged so it ca n't go above <>
1	" poll results not scientific , as the opinions of serfs do not matter "
2	its just an online poll its not representative of the whole country they ignore public opinion about much more important things politicians do n't care
6	what are they ( the pollsters ) smoking ?
6	i do n't smoke it either but until i hear a compelling argument about how its different than booze i do n't see why it should be treated any differently
5	i used to smoke , never enjoyed it all that much and have n't done it in about a year i think it 's ridiculous that people can go to jail over smoking , growing , or selling a plant
1	for that alone , i up voted you i myself do not smoke it but i find the whole idea of prohibition just completely mad ! yeah , hand control of an enormous industry worth billions to organised crime effin genius
6	also , that <> of the people voted for the " i like kittens " secret option
8	i think the main reason the gop stays in power is they constantly come down on the " easy " solutions lower taxes , less regulations the dems are always the ones who have to act like grownups and make the tough decisions that are better for the country as a whole no one likes to raise taxes , but sometimes you have to do it
8	that 's the point is n't it ? if the democrats can take responsibility for the recovery , their <> chances , as well as other elections down the road as well , are doomed they remember what happened with the new deal and the great depression they 'd rather be the ones who can take credit for it this time
2	dr alan sabrosky must be a real treat to talk to at a party until my eyelids shut and i start snoring

5	though labled as a jewish state i would beg to differ judaism and more importantly zionism have bastardized the religion into means for a theocratic regime there are many , many jews that do not support israel and it 's policies equating jew with loving israel is erroneous at best and intellectual dubious at worst
1	just curious as to why i was downvoted i would rather engage in a rational discussion but the op is adamant that anyone that makes a point that challenges him is jewlove blind
4	making light of a serious issue is a good strategy guess you 're just a " jewlove blind american " right ? hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahaahahahaahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahohwaithahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahahah thought i had you pegged !

8	thanks i try guess im just a " jewlove blind american "
6	tour ? ? ? tour ? ? ? pac paid for tour ? ? ? funny , i thought she said it was a vacation ? ? ? tour ? ?
3	i never thought about it , but it does seem weird that politicians can be selected for jury duty just like everyone else i 'd be scared shitless to have her kind of crazy on my jury
1	oh right the tour itself has n't been " canceled , " just the parts that involved travel , and stops in different cities , all of which had planned for her to deliver a canned speech , and had been notified of her impending arrival those all went belly up but they were n't canceled , they were just " descheduled " she did n't quit , damnit !
6	when i went on vacation i went on a tour of the grand canyon see how language works ?
1	yay now they can coerce us out of more of our civil liberties
2	great you know how unions protect the police right ? yeah , it will be just like that expect nothing to happen to these goons when you are sexually molested
1	fucking great guess my balls will still be fondled before boarding a plane
1	how lovely , higher taxes for jobs that wont ever end then we get to pay double when they retire
1	oh god we 're fooked
2	wait so now its going to be harder to fire a tsa worker who acts inappropriately ? i'm nuetral on unions but i thought originally the tsa was not supposed to be unionized in order to keep them from becoming lazy since they are ( supposedly ) in charge with keeping us safe at the airports
4	i'm glad someone can declare victory here certainly the flying public ca n't
1	it 's about fucking time ! oh , and he can skip the medicare cuts part of the deal medicare is not the problem , wars are the problem
1	the title makes it seem like it 's a victory ! it 's not we do n't need medicare cuts to balance the budget
2	hilarious the turd blossom certainly has a fine sense of the absurd the counter factual hits just roll in consecutively <> " he faces serious threats " really ? is that the threat from bachmann or gingrich or ? please <> " the economy is very weak " he knows this , because he and w made so certain of it during bush 's <> years <> " he 's defending unpopular policies " again , who would know this better than the champion of those unpopular policies gwb instituted and obama has continued ? <> " he 's made bad strategic decisions " mission accomplished ? greeted as liberators ? tora bora ? one of rove 's major skill sets is attributing his team 's own worst features to the opposing team and trying to make the other team somehow culpable watch for it every time
6	the intrade market still gives obama a <> chance of winning , pretty much a coin flip there 's money to be made if anyone really thinks they can predict better
4	and the article was written by karl rove made me lol , especially reading the phrases " he 's defending unpopular policies and he 's made bad strategic decisions "
6	very interesting that the gop is splitting over isolationism the influence of the tea party perhaps ?
6	how does nasa fit into this ?
6	however , cossiga has stated that he sees <> <> conspiracy theories as impossible and ideologically motivated in september <>
8	then we should get rid of the fed and the president should stop fucking with the economy if they have no clue what they 're doing
2	jpi claims the private industry hasn t merely responded to the nation s incarceration woes , it has actively sought to create the market conditions ( ie more prisoners ) necessary to expand its business darn straight they would be doing that if you privatize prisons , you 're effectively telling them that they are businesses now and what 's important to a business ? making as much profit as possible and how do you go about doing that ? doing more with less , gaining new customers , or research and development for either of those two so long as there 's a profit motive , privatized businesses are going to want more people in prison , not less , as it 's the easiest fix for their bottom lines as such , privatization schemes for things like this are downright absurd , as they encourage the sort of behavior in which you are n't wanting in the first place
8	you can have the scholarships , i will take making more money for no reason
5	if this is so , and this pill is unprofitable to make , transport , and store perhaps they should not make it because if sick people need this to get well , the demand is surely there if it 's just a sugar pill they could raise their prices to a <> , <> pop and nobody would care
1	what a bunch of horse shit this medication is being made profitably by generics manufacturers right now , they supply my country with it for <> per <> pills the chemical is public property , any company can make it and sell it , for however much they want to , and we will pay the fair market price if it costs money to ship and store , then that is included in the price what is it about americans and the ' free market ' ? they wank on about it to no end , but never actually use it , in any way , shape or form it 's corruption and nothing more , your country is full of it
1	is that what we are seeing here ? they said they filled <> million prescriptions and gout is n't particularly rare take your strawman somewhere else
2	the american way create a government body to supervise safety make it corrupt as fuck use this as justification to remove that supervision entirely
6	the first paragraph that you typed is beside the point , first of all second , you people never ceased to amaze me what ever happened to you tools always saying you want a free market economy ? the fda should not be giving any big business any market exclusivity , period
1	blame market regulations for cost of medical care
8	tl dr colchicine ( http en wikipedia org wiki colchicine ) has been used to treat gout for <> years upon submission of a randomized study , the fda granted the manufacturer exclusivity which raised the price and eliminated all competition this will increase costs to state medicaid programs from <> million to <> million
3	" market exclusivity " is not a white and black area of morality sometimes , the demand for a drug is so small that stops being economically feasible to produce it ( you have to remember that beyond the chemistry involved , there is also millions of dollars in overhead such as shipping and storage to be considered ) market exclusivity allows a company to raise prices without fear of being undercut , and thus moves the pill back into profitability the danger is when a company manages to convince the fda that something needs to be made exclusive when it actually does n't
2	is n't this is a clear example of the us not being a free market though ?
1	no , this is black as black as you can get colchicine has been used for many , many years for gout , a trial is not needed to know that it works , a trial is not needed to say that it can be very toxic , a trial is not required to define the side effects that have been known for literally a hundred years if formal trials are done it should not be done in such a way that it increases the price for the poor bastard suffering from gout from pennies to hundreds of dollars an absolutely tiny , one week trial with <> patients ? why ca n't this be funded with a small government grant ? people may have been using this medication for their entire lives , now many will not be able to afford it at all this study has given no more information than we had already that man does not benefit from this action in any way whatsoever , and neither does the many millions of men like him black black black i cannot believe the hand waving justifications in this thread , this as black and white as it gets , it 's blatant corruption i'm sure glad this shit does n't happen in my country that 's for sure colchicine remains at <> for a thousand pills , and the prescription costs for new zealand citizens remains capped at <> for however much they need that such as shit does n't stop america from wanting , funding , trying , and lobbying to destroy our drug purchasing agency though !
2	there is such a thing as good regulation , and then there is corruption this is the latter , and america loves it like nothing else
6	do you have any examples of market regulation increasing the cost of medical care ? or could you explain how the proposed regulations i listed in op would do anything but decrease the cost of health care ?
3	figures isentrope had it twisted maybe his unconscious ( ? ) capitalization of ' randomized ' should have tipped me off
8	lol , good point i guess it 's just that i do n't feel that completely support taking away all regulation , just doing in a smart way that is advantageous to people who need health care
8	granted , if every firm but one manages to back out of production , you 'll be okay but realistically , that 's not going to happen why not ? the better solution is for the state to pick the winner and disallow the others from competing ? that 's ludicrous if people refuse to pay prices high enough to keep any of those companies in business , then they 'll refuse to pay the monopoly price as well and nothing was gained none of what you 've said makes any economic sense i 'll tell you the real reason why the fda has this program it 's to give incentives for companies to go back and study drugs that never were properly studied ( by the fda 's standards ) that 's it it has nothing to do with making sure drugs do n't go off market as it guarantees no such thing
6	you do n't believe in a modern free market , you believe in a controlled market i believe in a free market with minor controlled features i do n't understand why i have to be for a free market or a totally controlled economy
2	why not offset those losses against pills they can sell for huge profits then i remember the answer greed uh , you do realize these drug manufacturing companies are businesses , right ? are you seriously suggesting that a private company should willingly take a financial loss on a product line ?
6	has it ever been through a propper clinical trial to test it 's effectiveness against gout ?
2	thanks i understand that novel drugs are difficult to produce due to the extreme risk , r & d costs , and developmental time except you forgot that this compound is already well known and studied so there is no need to develop novel equipment for developing , processing , or producing it this drug has already been approved by the fda , and it was a question of whether or not the drug had tangible benefits associated with it or if it was homeopathic medicine i reread the top comment you responded to just to check that we are focusing on this drug and not all drugs also i read http content healthaffairs org content <> <> <> full pdf html and the title is slightly misleading it is discussing " cost " as the opportunity cost of developing the drug , which is very different than the money spent so i will give you an example say you have a drug that costs <> billion to develop over <> years now lets say the investment is <> million each year with an interest rate of <> ( they use <> ) this what your rate of return would be if you had invested the money else where you can model this as an annuity and can calculate its future value ( year <> dollars ) and you get <> <> billion dollars ( in <> ) this is the opportunity cost to develop the drug in <> dollars why do i keep repeating <> ? because the number does not mean much until you convert it back to the current value of money that would be the opportunity cost to develop that drug however that is computed in terms of future value ( <> years into the future ) seen as a current annuity the present value it is <> million you see what i did there ? i spent <> billion over <> years which is worth <> million in present dollars or <> <> billion in future dollars unless you make it clear how you are calculating the money it is a very deceptive number
1	when i accused you of not reading my post , it was really just hyperbole i expected , in reality , that you had merely ignored part of my post so that you could respond with a snarky comment instead , by accusing me of ninja editing in that part , you 've revealed to me that you actually did n't read my post through before commenting regardless of what others might think , i know that i did n't edit in an entire sentence , which means that i know you dun goofed i'm embarrased for you
5	every time that i read about that corrupt fda it always ruins my day
2	no , this is why the fda fails get government out of the patent copyright racket , get them out of the health care sector
5	sometimes , when demand is weak enough and cost of production is high enough , there simply is n't enough room for multiple firms in the marketplace ? ? ? it 's going to take some serious mental gymnastics for that logic to fly xm sirius situation does not relate at all they wanted to merge but could n't until the state allowed them to xm was not trying to get the fcc to agree to disallow sirius from competing that would be ridiculous
2	? ? ? it 's going to take some serious mental gymnastics for that logic to fly i do n't understand what 's confusing you this is not something that is controversial or difficult to grasp say there are only <> , <> people in the country who need the drug in order to be economical , you discover that you must sell at least <> batches of the drug ( factoring in the price competitors are selling it for , how much you 'd have to invest in production , how many batches are manufactured per cycle , and how much insurance companies are willing to pay when covering the drug ) because there are <> other competitors in the marketplace , you find it unlikely that you will manage to capture that much of the market , and therefore you decide not to produce the drug granted , if every firm but one manages to back out of production , you 'll be okay but realistically , that 's not going to happen you 're going to have either an unprofitable struggle over market share , or everyone is just going to decide it is n't worth their fucking time and move on there is , after all , many other drugs they could be producing with their limited resources xm sirius situation does not relate at all they wanted to merge but could n't until the state allowed them to xm was not trying to get the fcc to agree to disallow sirius from competing that would be ridiculous they wanted to merge because they were effectively driving each other out of business by merging , they effectively stopped competition , which is the purpose of exclusive rights to manufacture of a drug
1	the reason i did n't copy the next line is because all the critics have is well nothing the only criticisms are " well we want more transparency " please find me a valid complaint somewhere in there haha some fucker comes up and says " it cost me <> billion to do x " , and you want to just take him at his word without asking questions ? if someone says " yes , i 'll believe you , but first please show me some numbers , prove to me that you spent it " then you dismiss the person as " just wants more transparency " ? it 's not more transparency , it 's the fucking crux of the argument the difference between blowing gas out your rear end and proving it you sound like some shill for the company , or else one of those weird people who believe business is good and the public is bad , even when business uses a government mandated coercive monopoly to skim the public i 'd much rather believe an independent investigator who says " they spent <> million and here are my numbers to show why " than a company that says " we spent <> billion , trust us ! " fuck that
5	the problem with that is that the drive for profit is what 's actually spurring the development of these drugs remove the profit incentive and you 'll have all the tylenol and motrin you need , but no revolutionary new stuff from thereon out i fully agree and understand what you 're saying there but the drive for profit energized by unchecked greed is what makes necessary drugs that cost a few cents to make cost hundreds of dollars a bottle for the patient continue on with profit as the primary incentive and let people with " unprofitable " illnesses fall by the wayside oh they would n't fall by the wayside those drugs would still get produced , just at such a high premium that the people that need them ca n't afford them it always blows my mind when at the end of some of the drug commercials , they put in the tagline of " ca n't afford your prescription ? big pharma may be able to help ! "
3	you ignored the rest of my post that rebuffed the two studies you cited cheap and numbers mean nothing unless you specify how the money was spent or how that value is calculated <> today is not <> billion in <> years <> billion in cash flow over <> years is not equal to <> when that cash flow begins your article explains acutely why drug research should not be a private enterprise well , then that means that pfizer , as the biggest and most merged up drug company in the world , must have minimized its risk more than anyone in the industry right ? and they should be doing just fine by that ? not laying people off right and left ? not closing any huge research sites ? not wondering frantically how they 're going to replace the lost revenue from lipitor ? not telling people that they 're actually ditching several therapeutic areas completely because they do n't think than can compete in them , given the risks ? not announcing a stock buyback program , because they apparently ( and rather shamefully ) think that 's a better use of their money than putting it back into more r & d ? i mean , how can intel be doing better than that ? it 's almost like chip design is a different sort of r & d business entirely the risk involved in the market is what kills companies like pfizer if they had enough money they could survive the swings , but when drug projects go up in flames it can destroy a company it 's why nasa pioneers space because without large funding and support by the government industries like spacex would have never seen the light of day
4	while i am a free market supporter myself ( and staunchly so , i might add ) , i have an anecdote that is relevant as a pharmacy technician it occurred about once every <> years that a person would come in requiring a rare and expensive drug occasionally they 'd only need <> pills or so , and rare and expensive drugs never come in quantities of <> often enough , you 'd need to order <> or more they 'd sit on the shelf until they expired and we 'd end up losing money for that reason , we generally refused to order the drug , under those exceedingly rare cases , and these people had to go elsewhere that said , mail order pharmacies will always provide those drugs
6	this will naturally lower the supply , which raises the price until the drug is profitable and when a disease is so rare that the drug will never be profitable ?
2	granted what the fda did was complete bullshit , but the exclusivity only exists for <> years , which means it should be set to expire next year , at which point i imagine other generics will begin to come back onto the market no the <> year exclusivity is for the treatment of gout in addition , they also received <> year exclusivity for the same drug for the treatment of fmf , as the article mentions the drug company is making a lot of money off the compound , but it 's probably invested a bit to have those studies done too if they only make <> , that would probably barely cover the cost of conducting the study no again it 's not a million dollars , it 's hundreds of millions of dollars huge difference again , what the article says is according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services , state medicaid programs filled about <> , <> prescriptions of colchicine in <> and paid approximately <> million for the drug use of the new brand name colchicine could add as much as <> million per year to these insurance programs ' budgets at a time when they are addressing the rising costs of health care by reducing some services or raising eligibility thresholds what they 're saying is that medicare and medicaid paid <> million for the drug in <> , before the exclusivity was granted in <> as a result of the exclusivity , they will now pay <> million per year over the <> year exclusivity period that would be <> million per years times <> years <> million now consider that these are medicare plus medicaid payments alone , which are only a fraction of the total healthcare expenditures plenty of people pay for treatment through their own private insurance through blue cross or whatever in <> when this drug was approved by the fda , medicare medicaid were only <> of us healthcare ( https www cms gov nationalhealthexpenddata <> nhe fact sheet asp ) about <> million out of <> <> trillion if you factor it over the entire us healthcare system , then the cost actually comes to <> million ( <> <> trillion <> million ) , which is <> million dollars there is a hell of a difference between <> million and <> million now , none of us knows what it cost the company to get the drug approved however , the average cost to bring a brand new drug to market in the us is about <> million this includes all research needed to develop the drug , all clinical trials from phase <> to phase iv , all legal and regulatory expenses and this is for a brand new drug colcrys is n't a new drug there was no research cost to develop the drug , it already existed there was no need for phase i or phase ii trials , the drug was already being sold legally in the market only phase iii trials were needed , so the cost was a very small fraction of that <> million i have n't seen the numbers , but i would be very surprised if their total costs exceeded <> million for a payoff of <> million the new england journal of medicine is one of the most prestigious in the field consider what they have to say , without going into any specific numbers although the goals underlying the development of colcrys were sound few would argue against the need to comply with fda requirements and the need to ensure the safety and efficacy of all prescription drugs and the manufacturer seems to have followed fda guidance , the reward appears to be out of proportion to the level of investment this is exactly what the argument is about that the reward is out of proportion to the investment , to the tune of <> , for something that brings " no meaningful improvement to public health "
8	laws which make it a crime to sell pills labeled " colchicine " which do not contain colchicine is government control of a market do you think it should be up to each individual consumer to evaluate the quality and safety of the ingredients in each pill he takes ? let people sell " prescription " drugs out of the back of a truck in some parking lot ? i agree that the events described in this nejm article show how government regulation coupled with apparently unbridled greed on the part of a private company have hurt the consumer in this case to me , the solution is to change the regulations so that research and development is supported , but the patient is not gouged the suggestion made in the article , that the fda foot the bill for clinical trials like the one that led to the temporary monopoly in this case , so that temporary monopoly is not justified and the consumer can continue to enjoy low priced medication , seems to be a better solution to the problem than your " magic market " elimination of all regulation
2	i am an adult , asshole , and i do not , under any circumstances , want the government to make decisions that effect exclusively my life , for me google " non aggression principle "
2	this kind of thing is probably to deal with the problem of effective old treatments which still need to be trialed have you ever heard the claim " xyz is a fatastic herbal natural etc treatment for abc but big pharma ignores it because you ca n't patent old herbal remadies " well it 's bullshit he who does the trial gets the patent if you had the money and ran a trial to prove your favorite herb was a good treatment for something you could get the patent on it hell if you find an out of patent drug and prove it can treat something new you might even get the patent on it 's use as a treatment for that trials are very expensive but they 're nesecary
6	never approved before ? colchicine 's been sold more years
1	there 's a reason why people actually study health care economics , because black and white does not exist there
6	if the other supplier has such a large stock that they can just dump it on the market at reduced rates , then when no one is willing to produce the drug from scratch why do n't they just sell it at normal rates , thus serving everyone and getting even more profits ?
2	which makes me ask the question , if the demand is enough to warrant making the pill but not getting a profit on it ( assuming that this is actually curing an actual disease , not just a " syndrome " and hauling along a bunch of other side effects with it ) , why not offset those losses against pills they can sell for huge profits then i remember the answer greed

2	that is not at all relevant to colchicine
1	fda does this kind of crap all of the time
2	the fda is one of the leading drivers of the rising cost of healthcare in the us it should be abolished
6	the point is to make sure rare drugs are n't taken off the market so how does this monopoly enforcing system guarantee that ? how does it guarantee not to price the needy out of the market by those predatory enough to abuse the system ? edit it would be interesting to see a study where the system actually worked as intended
2	this medication is a very common drug , and is already made by multiple generics manufacturers for very cheap your arguments have absolutely no relevance to this medication
8	the us is usually criticized as being a free , unregulated health services market
6	true i think it would be a cool experiment to give birth to it irl maybe on a small scale observe what happens , see if it works if it does , we have a model to strive after and if it does n't we could always point to it when a free market advocate says free markets ftw !

2	so what was the edit ? since it was n't a ninja edit , you mind telling the court and jury what it was exactly that you edited law of pizza sits quietly in the stand , with a look like a deer in headlights thought so , i rest my case your honor
2	the movie studios do it all the time remember the guy who actually played darth vader ? ( http www telegraph co uk culture film <> darth vadar actor claims he is missing out on return of the jedi payment html ) it just takes a little creative accounting besides , there 's always a middle ground price gouging and profit mongering with people 's lives drives me insane
4	i'm a flaming pinko socialist and i 'd rather have a free market than this
1	us having no fucking money is why healthcare fail
1	this is the problem with over regulation edit i very much agree that the us healthcare system is a failure , but i also think obama 's health care overhaul was adding fail on top of fail i have disapproved of obama 's plan since the beginning and people think that means i support the status quo it does n't
1	this is why you should n't let governments control markets any market
1	u s a ! u s a ! u s a !
6	but it magically becomes better once someone has the exclusive right to produce it , did n't anyone ever tell you this
2	it 's a transparent transfer of wealth from medicaid medicare , and the poor minorities that tend to get gout , to a pharmaceutical company that has contributed essentially nothing to our knowledge of colchicine this kind of blatant corruption seems to be the usual in your country i'm afraid
6	obamacare not working out ?
1	this , <> times this granted i believe all federal bureaucracies should be abolished
6	granted what the fda did was complete bullshit , but the exclusivity only exists for <> years , which means it should be set to expire next year , at which point i imagine other generics will begin to come back onto the market the fda had previously never approved colchicine because it had n't completed the randomized study that you 're talking about the drug company is making a lot of money off the compound , but it 's probably invested a bit to have those studies done too if they only make <> , that would probably barely cover the cost of conducting the study
1	the trial was fucking useless doctors now know nothing more now about colchicine than they did before , but their patients now need to fork out thousands of dollars for something that should cost literally pennies i do n't live in your country , thank god , and people here wo n't get fucked like yours will i feel sorry for you i really do
8	recouping costs gone into research , development , testing , etc it costs a ton of money to go from idea to actual drug , so if anyone can just come in and market the drug purely based on how much it takes to create an individual pill , then of course they 're going to be undercut profiting off the sale of an individual pill recouping development costs
6	if someone was able to undercut them , then how was it not profitable ? dumping stock to cut losses
6	next time , you might want to finish reading the post before you comment yeah , right there at the bottom , the part where i make essentially the same point you 're making
8	because if sick people need this to get well , the demand is surely there demand may be there , but profitability might not if only <> , <> people in the entire country need the pill , it might cost more to make , store , and ship than they get back in revenue sure , they can raise the prices above the cost , but then without market exclusivity they run the risk of another supplier dumping their stock on the market at reduced rates just to cut their losses
8	this drug is profitable as it is the rest of the world will continue to pay the free market price , which is <> a pill
6	second , you people never ceased to amaze me what ever happened to you tools always saying you want a free market economy ? whosawhatsit now ? who 's " you people " and when did i ever say i wanted a pure free market economy ?
6	and some people claim the us has a free market lulz
6	and imagine this could have been avoided if the us government deemed it beneficial to conduct the same study , but socialism , so a private manufacturer did it and now reaps the benefits
4	i love the conservative mindset rail against public option that would lower healthcare costs , rail against patent buying that would lower the cost of drugs for everyone in the country , rail against states and the country banding together to buy drugs in bulk to lower healthcare costs blame liberals for cost of medical care
1	that is not relevant to colchicine it is already on the market this study was absolutely tiny , only one week long you are wrong , very wrong
6	better yet , just a simple university research grant for such a tiny study it would have costed far less than a million dollars , let alone hundreds of millions
2	while that 's a matter of contention , it 's what conservatives ( the ones who actually have an understanding of conservative economics , anyway ) will actually blame this could n't have happened in a free market
6	so they dumped their stock someone will pick up the demand after that why guarantee anyone profits in the short term ?
6	out of curiosity do you beleive patents and copyrights are anti thetical to free markets ?
6	yes what 's your point ?
2	this must be some definition of " aggressive " i had previously been unaware of
1	once again , another attempt to curb piracy that will only piss of costumers i'm pretty sure comcast and at & t will be all over this , not so sure about the others
6	you know what ? we honestly need to start doing this here as well i'm surprised i have n't heard anything about how dc has been flooded with protesters due to the behavior that the gop has had make it uncomfortable for them there in dc , and it will only help to make them look worse in <> for their actions otherwise , they just might get a free pass on this
6	is it wrong that my first reading of this headline was " virginia tech " and not " vermont " ?
6	it makes sense to me , why should n't a pharmacist be able to sell anonymized data on what prescriptions they fill to anyone ? the data could already be sold to research groups
6	the fuck ?
4	yeah this is really stupid the <> amendment already has this clause in it glad to know our leadership understands our constitution
6	uh correct me if i'm wrong but does not the <> amendment to the constitution guarantee the inalienable right to equal protection under the law ? these lawmakers creating new redundant legislation rather than defending the existing legislation is undermining the entire base of our system of laws
2	war profiteers like crack dealers selling rocks to the dude
2	do n't talk to me about obama and the deficit ( http en wikipedia org wiki reaganomics )
6	why ? in rep speak they would called " revenue enhancements " and everybody would vote for them
5	democrats wanted to raise taxes and eliminate loop holes thats a double hit they may want to raise taxes on the super rich ( this is something obama has suggested a number of times ) , but in this particular negotiation , as i understand it , all democrats are asking for is an elimination of subsidies , tax breaks , and loopholes for big businesses and anyway , that 's not a " double hit " it is , at most , a " single hit " ( but since taxes on the rich are far lower than they should be in an ostensibly progressive taxation system , that 's debatable ) again , closing tax loopholes is not the same as raising taxes it 's just eliminating methods of cheating the system also many republicans were for eliminating ethonal subsides and the like why did n't that pass ? many democrats are for eliminating ethanol subsidies as well and it did pass the final senate vote ( http www reuters com article <> <> <> us usa senate ethanol idustre75f5in20110616 ) on the measure was <> <> in favor the white house has said they 're against ending ethanol subsidies , but it 's not quite accurate to suggest republicans were all for it and democrats were all against
6	correction republicans wanted to eliminate many loop holes but leave rates the same democrats wanted to raise taxes and eliminate loop holes thats a double hit also many republicans were for eliminating ethonal subsides and the like why did n't that pass ?
4	imagine joe mccarthy dragging cabinet members into hearings and demanding that they publicly disavow the works of groucho marx , and you get a rough idea of the general style of bachmannian politics hahahahaha
4	wryly amusing
1	considering that a number of prominent economists , oil industry executives , and regulatory agencies have blamed the inflated price on market speculation , he deserves to get slammed for doing this and not fixing the damn problem its real damn simple , if you do n't have the capabilities to accept future delivery of the contracts then you ca n't buy them fuckers sitting in an office in wall street do n't have anywhere to put millions of barrels of oil , and once you force them to have that in order to play the game it is no longer worth the risk right now they just buy up futures contracts and resell them to each other , limiting the supply of oil futures contracts to actual suppliers and driving up the price just undo bush 's commodity futures modernization act and the price will come down fairly significantly , like <> <> per barrel edit i had n't considered that this move will fuck over some of the speculators on contracts they are holding , so that part is nice
6	you must have made your edit when i was typing my response to your comment it will be interesting to see what this does to the speculation for a little while edit spelling
1	so , let 's see , the piece was written by a guy who is a senior fellow at the brookings institution and was the co editor with william kristol of present dangers crisis and opportunity in american foreign policy ( <> ) no , there 's certainly no partisan bullshit being laid down here
6	they will soldier on and do their best , but as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , adm mike mullen , put it , in characteristic understatement , they believe the decision will increase the risk to the troops and increase the chance that the mission will not succeed what 's that mission again ? stay in afghanistan perpetually ?
1	what horse shit !
4	funny , they said basically the same thing about vietnam
6	a disaster to the for profit war machine ? ?
6	wow ron paul has pulled in <> from the marijuana lobby since <> quite the haul
2	ever think that this is because these two men already say " crazy " things in congress and fight for the tough issues ? if they gave their lobbying money ( all <> of it ) to some other dude , he would probably just take it and never even offer real support they would make an off hand comment to a local hack and then let it all die down while avoiding calls from the lobbyists this is a positive story framed as a negative one
1	no shit ? i interviewed a chamber of commerce lobbyist the other day and he said his organization regularly sends checks to legislators who vote " pro business " is it not understood that lobbyists reward legislators who promote their agendas ? that 's sort of their primary function
4	scumbag reddit is against bribes lobby money its okay tho this time because its for an issue i support
1	you 're kidding right ? ? <> and <> contributions are a drop in the drop in a bucket compared to what insurance companies , big pharma , oil and gas companies and now any corporations who wants to use to bribe congress !
3	it 's ok when ron paul does it because he is doing it in everyone 's best interest come on sheeple , wake up ! when other politicians take money , it is for evil purposes sheeple , wake up sheeple
4	thanks for adding to the discussion
6	why should generics have a duty to warn when primary does not ? " federal law requires the original makers of these brand name drugs to include an approved and up to date warning label that tells doctors and patients of possible side effects or complications but in a <> <> decision , the high court said this duty to warn patients of newly revealed dangers does not extend to the makers of generic drugs "
8	you ca n't know the side effect unless the manufacturers tell you they have the burden of sharing the side effects , not the public that ca n't do the tests themselves
8	you ca n't know the side effect unless the manufacturers tell you they have the burden of sharing the side effects , not the public that ca n't do the tests themselves
1	the manufacturer is telling you a generic is essentially a copy of the original product if something is wrong with the original product 's formula , the company making it is responsible for informing the public , not the person copying it let 's just say you take a generic version of medicine a then a news story breaks that medicine a causes massive diarrhea if you do n't stop taking your generic because you did n't know it was the same drug as medicine a , you 're stupid
4	thank you for the correction
4	i'm glad that the court saw fit to protect my constitutionally enshrined right to receive a severe neurological disorder when i'm treating my acid reflux clearly this is directly in line with the framer 's intentions
1	okay puts on hat that 's it grabs suitcase i'm moving to a different country this is bullshit and they know it opens the door i hope they 're given generic drugs when they 're in the hospital steps out and i hope they die of complications slams door shut
1	get this shit to the front page
2	unequal protection
6	what this decision is based on , and what it means is confusing why should generics have a duty to warn when primary does not ? clearly both should be obligated to provide such warnings that is the problem with three sentence abstracts of a court case you never really know what they mean or what they apply to
1	then stop taking them !
8	it appears that primary manufacturers still have to provide warnings of side effects if you do n't know the brand equivalent of your generic medicine , then you 're simply a fucking ignorant patient know what you put in your body simple as that
2	i mean you already have a bad finger , what else could go wrong
2	but what about dressing a couple of animals a year in the backyard ? how can that be compared to a conagra or tyson facility ? in the eyes of the government , the two are one and the same i seriously doubt this my grandfather had a farm ( for his own sustenance ) which he slaughtered cows every year for <> years maybe he was technically breaking a law but it obviously was n't enforced as for this guy 's other bitching , if you create a product which you plan to sell to the public then you have to comply with government regulations that are in place for the safety of the public if you do n't like it then do something else
2	the author sells his meat to the public ever see food inc ? the guy killing the chickens outdoors is the author the guy that says he knows his outdoor kitchen produces cleaner chicken than a stainless steel kitchen approved by the usda fda a question that immediately comes to mind for you is , when is the cost of safety too high for you ? there 's a line for everybody , safety is never the <> concern despite what people say say i am selling chickens , really healthy ones i can sell you a chicken that was absolutely guaranteed to be <> safe to eat , no bacteria on it , no cancer causing chemicals , no non chicken particles , no dust , meat grown from all organic feed in healthy , humane conditions my chickens cost <> million dollars each you interested in buying one ? i bet not hyperbole ? sorta let 's tone it down for the real world then lets imagine i'm a parent looking to feed my five children i know this guy joe who raises chickens , really great chickens , he sells them to all sorts of people and everybody raves about them except he slaughters his chickens outdoors , not in an all stainless steel kitchen his chickens are pretty cheap compared to the store chickens , and they are higher quality so i buy them to feed my family i'm saving money , my family is happy , joe is selling his chickens , everybody is happy now here comes the usda , they go to joe 's farm and see he 's slaughtering chickens outdoors that 's not okay says the usda it 's not " clean , " it is n't " safe " of course , the usda is n't basing these claims on fact , they 're making broad generalizations they do n't test joe 's chickens after he slaughters them for bacteria , they have no interest in actual facts such as those they 're merely there to enforce rules so now joe stops selling chickens , which means i have to go elsewhere for my family 's poultry now i'm paying more to feed my family , joe is making less money , i'm saving less who is benefiting in this situation ? the large chicken producers like tyson or conagra and possibly the government ( from higher tax revenue , although tyson probably uses crazy loopholes to avoid paying taxes while at the same time throwing large amounts of cash into politics , making politicians do more of their bidding ) so why am i forced to buy this " safer , cleaner " meat if i do n't want to ? why is joe prevented from selling a product that i want ? because the large companies do n't want competition , because the government has control over what you can put into your mouth , because they say so it 's ridiculous there 's a possibility that i am subjecting myself to sickness if i choose a non usda approved chicken to eat , but there 's that possibility when choosing approved meat too ( meat recalls anyone ? ) i'm trying to give my family the best and to support a humane , healthy , sustainable business , but the government wo n't allow that but if we do n't like it , then we should do something else ? no screw that when actions are taken without using facts , those actions are pointless when i ca n't buy something that benefits me in multiple ways , screw that when i ca n't support a business that benefits the environment in multiple ways , screw that
2	squirm dogs !
5	man , he still does n't get it " the daily show " is a comedy show it airs on comedy central and yet , wallace keeps trying to compare fox news to the daily show as if to say " see ? we do things so much better than their show " you would think that comparing his own show to a comedy show would be damaging to whatever reputation that wallace thinks he has
1	yeah , seriously somebody 's actually asking for john yoo 's asshole opinion , that torture defending dickface ?

2	i would rather call this data mining of sales data from prescription information medical data mining might at least have some health application this is only a mechanism for the pharmaceutical houses to reward prescribers who specify their products , and to target those prescribers who do n't
2	right , because married couples are known to be much more promiscuous
2	apparently , trombley s fellow legislatures were silent , some of them shaking their heads in disagreement as he spoke a sign of how backwards and uneducated this asshat is
6	i was shocked , shocked i say , to see that this politician is a republican
2	the justice dept should investigate every member of the house and senate wait never mind , someone needs to investigate the justice dept as well
8	you deserve more upvotes
2	in my humble opinion i think you are over simplifying things i think paul 's main concern is that we have a private corporation who is owned by individuals unknown to the public that has been given the ability to indebt current and future generations of taxpayers but they are n't being watched or governed by anyone do you really think it is just about gold ? gold and whether our currency is backed by it is a moot point when the foxes are given reign of the hen house and are giving millions to banks , corporations , foreign countries , and private citizens while <> of our populations worries whether they will be able to pay the bills in the future i'm not going to say that i am a supporter of ron paul i despise the entire political system and its players in my country and thinks the whole system should burn in the fires of valhalla but i do support his principles because i know that out country will be a better place if private corporations are put under the same amount of scrutiny as private individuals who are spied on , robbed via income taxes , stripped down , groped , monitored , and abuse on an ongoing basis this is no longer about left and right , christians and muslims , and whatever else they use to divide us it is bigger than that either we change what it happening or we all lose so we have to work together
8	i knew about that story but i think the fact that he has always owned gold and gold stocks and wants to move to a policy where we <> ) use a currency that is backed by more than debt and <> ) audit the private corporation that has been used to transfer trillions in wealth from the hand of the many and middle class to the hands of the few corporations , banks and elites who are the primary owner of <> of the financial wealth in the us more than outweighs his personal ownership of gold plus i 'd rather see that he privately owns gold rather than shares of haliburton , boeing , and lockheed martin which indicate that he directly profits from warmongering do you honestly think we would be worse off as a country by auditing the fed and having a currency that is backed by gold and not just something imaginary made up in a computer in the federal serve ? do you not understand the fact that having a currency backed by debt is only inflationary and distorts the principles of basic economics because it <> ) eliminates deflationary cycles , <> ) punishes savers through inflation and <> ) requires infinite consumption and credit creation in order for the system to grow not everyone understands basic economics in reality versus some textbook theory so i fully understand why you would n't know these things
5	i agree ron paul aside my view is that a move to a currency backed by gold is needed as is auditing the fed but i think we have gone beyond that point of no return now as china by gold as a state and tells it citizens to do the same it only take them to switch to a gold backed currency for our country to devolve into a banana republic in general , while i agree with you statement about the defense contractors providing tools to support our troops , i do n't think it would be necessary if were did n't have active military bases in over <> countries and have military engagements in no less than <> different countries my biggest concern that our military build up and currency decline is eerily similar to the last decade of the roman empire and while i am ready for a collapse most of the country and its leaders are n't and my view is that a move to a metal back currency and holding the fed to be responsible to someone other than itself will soften this potential fall for <> of the population
8	but i think the fact that he has always owned gold and gold stocks and wants to move to a policy where we <> ) use a currency that is backed by more than debt and <> ) audit the private corporation that has been used to transfer trillions in wealth from the hand of the many and middle class to the hands of the few corporations , banks and elites who are the primary owner of <> of the financial wealth in the us more than outweighs his personal ownership of gold who do you think actually owns most of the gold out there ? is it just millions of americans or more likely is it multinational corporations and huge banks ? ron paul is pushing for a commodity back currency that he just happens to own millions of dollars worth ? it 's no surprise that ron paul is doing very well financially right now , and if his financial plans came to fruition he would stand to make a considerable profit ( http ca biz yahoo com siliconalley <> http www businessinsider com what ron paul invests in <> <> id html ? v <> ) i'm all for auditing the fed and finding out where all the funds are , but to suggest that ron paul 's financial theories are altruistic and for the benefit of the average american is lunacy plus i 'd rather see that he privately owns gold rather than shares of haliburton , boeing , and lockheed martin which indicate that he directly profits from warmongering you do realize that all those companies , while they do have defense contracts , do more than just " warmonger " , right ? you 're saying that it 's more important to you that he not invest in companies that build the equipment that hopefully keeps our troops safe than the fact he 's pushing for legislation that will make him a billionaire ? setting aside ron paul 's isolationism , his financial ideas sound great on paper , but monetarism has already proven to be a failure i agree our currency has problems and right now is only serving to benefit a small sector of america , but backing it with gold does n't fix the problem , it just serves to benefit a different sector namely one that ron paul is a part of
6	yeah , gold isnt worth anything and we dont need it for our national economy right i wonder why china bought <> metric tons of the shit back in <>
8	about time someone brought this up at least one politician is n't a complete and utter fraud who only listens to his biggest donors regardless of logic
6	what is the argument against doing this ?
6	actually verifying that the value of the gold entrusted as a reserve matches their financial statements is that a bad thing ?
4	whether the gold is there or not is a moot point our currency is n't backed by gold anymore and , thankfully , never will be again the problem with conspiracy theorists is that they already have their conclusion and will bend the facts to affirm it if the audit comes back as expected , ron paul and his supporters will simply claim the audit was rigged this is nothing but a waste of time and money and the congress has better things to do than worry about shiny metals
6	yea , and it 's weird that gold has remained so stable in value for hundreds of years the chinese are messed up man
2	yeah ! it 's about time a politician does n't do something that entirely benefits his own finances whoops ( http blogs alternet org speakeasy <> <> <> ron pauls holding big money in gold mining stocks washington post hints at subtle corruption ) so he audits the fed to find out how much gold is there if it 's less than they say then his gold goes up in value if it 's appropriate then he uses it as justification for a commodity back currency ( aka gold ) and then the value of gold sky rockets , thus his personal value increases totally legit
8	agreed people genuinely do n't understand that the fact that gold is of limited supply and is a precious metal is why it has acted as currency for thousands of years every fiat currency every created will cease to exist but gold and silver have acted as <> ) a means of exchange and <> ) a store of value look at the fall of rome and you will see that near the end of the empire people hoarded gold and silver coins because the government started devalue other coins by minimizing the amount of gold and silver in the coins to the point that no one would take them sound familiar ?
8	that reminds me of a line in an old movie about race relations " did they promise you any white women , boy ? " a white southern cop asks a black man arrested for some crime connected to northern civil rights activism i forget the movie ( and maybe i got the context wrong ) , but i will always remember that line
6	which is why his mom is one ?
4	he should be able to win because he 's a republican a lot of moderates could feel comfortable voting for as of now , his views are left of the current president
1	congratulations congress ! you 've just now realized what half the fucking country has known and been demanding since the beginning of this whole mess !
5	and still these savings will not be enough the only answer is to get rid of the bush tax cuts and raise taxes on the rich
1	<> puppies ca n't be wrong !
6	since when did the conservatives start caring about cutting the deficit ?
3	republicans could n't pull this sort of thing if the usa had a functioning tv news media that reported what they were doing
6	what a bunch of babies
6	why do people vote for the them again ?
3	for national security 's sake , we should just detain these economic terrorists at guantanimo bay
2	cutting the deficit in real fiscal terms means a desire to cut economic growth i mentioned this in another thread but the basic explanation is as follows economic growth per gdp means you have a concommitant fiscal expansion in a fiat monetary system , this can come from three places ( <> ) current accounts surplus ( e g an external surplus ) , ( <> ) public deficit , or ( <> ) private deficit the us runs a current accounts deficit ( and it will continue to do so ) , so there must be a net deficit domestically to support growth since the private sector is attempting to run a surplus right now due to poor growth projections and the inherent risk on the microeconomic scale of deficit spending with low aggregate demand in the consumer sector , the magnitude of deficit the public sector runs will strongly correlate with expected growth i suspect most of the reason people believe cutting the deficit is an imperative is because they think about monetary economics in terms of when the us was on the gold standard and they tend to apply budgetary constraints and norms that roughly correspond to their personal finances the problem with such reasoning is neither is applicable to a non convertible fiat currency on a floating exchange rate from the position of a sovereign issuer , such currencies are not a form of barter ( e g they are not structurally interchangeable with real economic output ) but rather a means of directing economic output thus , the real macroeconomic constraints on the federal government are the convergent effects of real capacity , demand for the currency , and aggregate demand which will largely determine the degree to which the government can direct economic output to public programs since the us is well below full utilization , this is not a realistic risk even in the face of spending on the order of a few of gdp

2	i do n't understand how republicans ( whom we all know are racists ) could be against an organization that was founded on the principles ( http en wikipedia org wiki margaret sanger eugenics and euthanasia ) of reducing the black population clearly , somebody is lying
2	i was just about to post the same thing seems like a lot of posts in r politics have been editorialized to make it bigger than it seems i believe if people have to over exaggerate it to make a point , then they probably did n't have a point to begin with
8	see this is in itself a pretty important development , but it was killed by the misleading headline the republicans declared tax increases off the table and appear ready to play chicken with going into default that is important the editorializing that has no basis in the article was n't important
4	you 're making it sound like obama did n't want to do it and he was only doing it as a compromise yeah , i 've heard a lot about what obama " would like to do " , but guess what ? you do n't look at that if you did obama would be the best president ever you look at what a president has done not what he claims to have liked to done only pandering idiots like you fall for that by your logic the vietnam war is now the kennedy war oh boy i love it when you can attribute a policy to the first president that implements rather than also the proceeding presidents that follow it obama signed the tax cuts into law he supported the bill that extended them , so they 're his it does n't matter what he says ( you seem the be the only person who still does n't " get it " ) , it matters what he does he extended the tax cuts they 're his bush did n't sign them , bush did n't even voice support for the extension you are tripping over yourself trying to convince yourself that because obama did n't support in his heart what he signed into law it should n't be attributed to him , but somebody else who literally had nothing to do with the bill that was signed into law it 's hilarious and pitiful at the same time
8	no , he means the bush tax cuts bush proposed them , pushed for them and got them passed when obama passed an extension it was a part of a compromise to allow for spending to help the economy recover that 's hardly enough to call them " obama 's tax cuts "
6	reddiquette is just advice , not a binding rule everytime mods do ban something like this , it inevitably leads to " omg so and so censored me " especially in r politics so basically , you 're too afraid to lose internet credit from your e friends to moderate ? what 's the point of having moderation in the first place ? this is why reddit is a laughable place to find information
4	yes we can ! herpderp
2	no , he means the bush tax cuts bush proposed them , pushed for them and got them passed this is wrong those tax cuts expired the current extension was pushed for and signed by obama they 're obama 's tax cuts he supported them actively and signed them into law you can lie to yourself all you want , but it just makes you look like a pandering delusional idiot if you seriously believe bush has anything to do with the tax cut extension gto
8	really you 're debating semantics at this point the rich got a two year extension of their tax cuts that were set to expire it 's true to say that after <> their taxes paid would be higher than they are today , but it 's also true to say that extending the benefits would be granting them a tax cut that they 're not currently entitled to
6	how do we keep them from getting back in ?
2	ironic that your user name is anti fox news , and yet you editorialize and lie about the news as much as they do

4	" representative eric cantor , the no <> republican in the house of representatives , said participants had identified trillions of dollars in potential spending cuts but were deadlocked over tax increases sought by democrats republican senator jon kyl also pulled out , according to an aide " they did not walk out of congress , only of the negotiations , unlike some wisconsin democrats who i sure you would argue were only doing the people 's will second , they did not walk out over lowering taxes for the " rich " or defunding planned parenthood they walked out over democratic insistence on raising taxes your headline is simply a lie , plain and simple
1	fuck the gop let there be no budget then and see what happens
6	" breaking ? " that 's a downvotin '
6	time for obama to make those recess appointments ?
1	breaking that 's called aggressive negotiation we should call them out on their bullshit of using childish tactics to get their way
1	oh god , this country is fucked obama is just going to cave here there goes my financial aid
1	news flash if the us defaults and we 're plunged into another recession , all those people they want to extend the bush tax cuts for will make even less money tl dr suck it up and swallow your goddamn medicine , upper class
6	ca n't they just vote without them ?
1	that means downvote the fuck out of this submission guys ( whether you agree or disagree ) , not delete it
6	most people just do n't understand this , and i do n't know why not
6	most people just do n't understand this , and i do n't know why not
3	he had better not !
5	sensationalized headline they did n't walk out of congress these are budget talks my understanding is that the talks are between leaders of both parties , with biden presiding the talks are not part of standard congressional business
6	i'm not sure you understand how being an elected official works
5	because bush 's tax cuts for the wealthy are scheduled to sunset , extending those cuts would be the same as providing a tax break so insisting that the cuts be extended is the same as saying that " they will not agree to any budget bill that does not lower taxes for the rich "
2	that republicans will not under any circumstance entertain any tax increase proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that they are not serious about balancing the budget and reducing the deficit no solution will be found without spending cuts and revenue increases every day it becomes clearer that their main goal is to keep the deficits high and the economy in the toilet until the <> election while acting like they want the opposite
8	you 're very defensive in your arguments do you think calling me a " pandering idiot " and proclaiming that i'm the only one that does n't " get it " is productive towards getting me to see your opinion ? my guess is you just want to call people names online , so enjoy )
1	they also said " now we are off to dine on the blood of <> tabby cats and club some baby seals to be stuffed and used as pillows in the mansion ! "
2	if you changed your party affiliation i bet fox news would hire you as a headline copywriter what an idiotic distortion of what actually happened
1	keep the scumbag republicans out keep the hypocritical democrats out keep everyone who wants to be a politician out of public office as they 're always predisposed to being scum
1	and stay out !
1	lock the doors so they ca n't get back in
1	turd burglars !
6	irs " how many thousand did you make last year ? send it in " or " how many millions did you make last year ? heres your check "
8	let them shut down the government or default on a bit of the debt the democrats caving in for two years only lead to an election defeat the democrats have been more than willing to compromise with the republicans , and the proper response to either them them leaving negotiations should just be " grow up dude "
6	what really offends me is that people upvoted this
1	bottom line , you fucking liberal parasites are going to have to cut lots of spending we are not going to let you weasel out of it like usual we have you by the balls and we are not going to let your messiah kick the can down the road just because he thinks it will help his election chances deal with it
1	time to grab my pitchfork , this shit has gone on long enough !
2	lets everybody try to remember these names when re election time rolls around , ok
6	fire all the ones that walked out ?
1	for fuck sake if you have a ( d ) senator or congressman , tell them not to cave in if democrats are anything they are shitty poker players understandably so since they got slapped around a little last midterm and they will totally pander to the right to not get slapped again being " disillusioned " and turning your backs will do nothing here
1	fuck those guys seriously they ca n't even be civil about it
8	does anybody actually read the articles ? ? there was no walkout of congress cantor and mcconnell walked out of negotiations not like all of congress left and it had nothing to do with pp it was all about tax increase for the rich
2	misinformation can be fun ! way to go , op you 're the douchiest of all the douche bags ! dooooooosh
2	fanatical , whoring assholes , every one of them
6	you mean the obama tax cuts right ? the bush tax cuts expired obama signed the current tax cuts into law
8	the oil and gas subsidies are not true subsidies rather , they are tax breaks for things like capital depletion to which every mining type industry which depletes its stock " big oil " is simply easy to demonize you can say you are ending tax breaks to big oil and simply not mention the fact that every corporation also gets those benefits the domestic manufacturing deduction allows you to deduct <> of your income for domestic manufacturing , growing , and extracting in the us every company is entitled to this deduction the gas and oil industries are the only ones who can only deduct at <> for no other reason than some politician wanted to look tough by " standing up to big oil " there is no subsidy or tax break that the oil and gas industries qualify for that is specific to them they do not get special treatment under the tax code period tax breaks that benefit wealthy individuals is also a rather misleading phrase what it is referring to , more likely than not and we 'll find out in a few days if i'm wrong , is not a reduction in only the upper personal income tax rates they are talking about reducing certain types of taxes , like the taxes you would pay if you sold stock that increased in price , that are especially harmful to economic activity all taxes marginally slow the economy to gain some extra revenue so transferring money from the tax payer to the government has some cost to society some taxes , like a flat sales tax , do n't reduce the economy by that much for the amount of revenue they bring in some , like capital gains taxes , reduce the economy by a lot for the amount of revenue they bring in by reducing those taxes , society does not pay as much for government
5	i do n't have any faith
8	relax buddy
8	reddiquette is just advice , not a binding rule everytime mods do ban something like this , it inevitably leads to " omg so and so censored me " especially in r politics
2	right the more sensationalized the title is , the less credible the story appears to be the title is the first impression in which people get about a particular story if it stays calm , rational , and informative of the actual content , it helps to keep the discussion about the story to be calm , rational , and informative so , in a way , it important for helping to establish where the thread is going to go , since while many redditors are fairly decent with at least glancing over the content of an article before posting , they 're still using the title as a way in which to get them engaged in the first place besides , it 's not really good reddiquette either
5	i'm starting to feel like these vote counts are all rigged would not surprise me anymore
6	actually , zero of three the republicans did n't walk out of congress , they walked out of the budget talks they are two totally different things on a related issue , how does this thread make the first page ? clearly , the thread title is total bullshit , so what conclusion do you draw ? do you assume that the majority of the people on reddit are just too stupid to know what is really going on ? or do you assume that they know the truth , but willingly upvote lies in order to attack their opponents ?
8	no it 's not it 's tantamount to saying " they will not agree to any budget bill that sees taxes increase for the rich " the rich already have the tax cuts thanks to the bush tax breaks if they are n't renewed it 's a raise in taxes , if they are extended it 's not new tax cuts it 's maintaining the same level of taxes
1	i'm referencing the people brkello was talking about that did not complete college ! ! ! !
1	are you serious ? you 're a fucking imbecile ( http www nytimes com <> <> <> us first black elected to head harvard s law review html )
6	yes he was elected president of law review but nowhere in the article are the connections to fellow classmates as far as i know no one has come forward as a friend classmate kinda weird just one link http www freerepublic com focus f news <> posts i do n't have a classmate who ever knew barack obama at columbia ever ! nobody recalls him i'm not exaggerating , i'm not kidding " root adds that he was also , like obama , " class of '83 political science , pre law " and says , " you do n't get more exact or closer than that never met him in my life , do n't know anyone who ever met him at the class reunion , our <> reunion five years ago , who was asked to be the speaker of the class ? me no one ever heard of barack ! and five years ago , nobody even knew who he was the guy who writes the class notes , who 's kind of the , as we say in new york , the macha who knows everybody , has yet to find a person , a human who ever met him is that not strange ? it 's very strange " obama 's photograph does not appear in the school 's yearbook and obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at columbia , provide school records , or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at columbia http en wikipedia org wiki wayne allyn root column one note root graduated as valedictorian from his high school , thornton donovan school , then graduated from columbia university in <> as a political science major ( in the same class as president barack obama was supposed to have been in )
4	i realize we 're all related , but it 's just funny to see the link
6	palin 's record may be sketchy but obama 's is non existent and nobody remembers him not one classmate buddy not one very bizarre
2	college does not quantify intelligence see einstein , albert gates , bill please do not construe this as me defending palin , she 's an idiot
4	hahahahaha god you 're an idiot ( http www nytimes com <> <> <> us first black elected to head harvard s law review html )
2	you do n't graduate magna cum laude from harvard as the president of the harvard law review , and garner the sort of praise from professors obama did , without being smart if you do n't think he 's incredibly intelligent , you 're an idiot
6	in what way did you read my comment as saying this ?
6	show me the public record to back this claim where is the school record of such an accomplishment
8	brkello obviously , the branch obama came from must have got the intelligence gene since he was actually able to graduate top of the class in harvard you college does not quantify intelligence
6	historically , tax revenue as a percentage of gdp has been pretty much constant because of that , should n't we be more concerned with growing gdp than increasing tax rates ?
5	historically , maybe , but not currently current tax rates , especially on the wealthy are at all time lows , and that and the wars are the reasons for our huge deficit it 's " starve the beast " time
1	obama hates small business and israel so you have no point face it , obama sucks as president
2	say you start a forest fire , when the fire looks like it 's about to be contained , and the authorities start investing man power to track down who started the fire , what do you do ? start another forest fire ! that will keep the attention away from you so you can go off and perform some more mischief this is the republican strategy for staying in office eventually you will run out of forests to burn
6	" the reality here is until our republican colleagues are more concerned about our need to reduce the deficit than they are worried about what grover norquist will say , were going to have a really difficult time reducing the deficit , " he van hollen said exactly it 's called compromise you 're not going to get everything that you want when doing it , and you might have to do things which are distasteful to you , but it ends up resulting in something in which both parties can agree to the gop has n't done much of anything to show that they have been willing to compromise at all , and instead have been using this as a coded excuse to try to insist that they get everything their way as such , they threw a tantrum when they essentially found out that they would need to compromise so , this leads me to think that either they never were serious about this to begin with , and just wanted to stall , or they just do n't really care if they want to rejoin now , they should have to lose a little bit of face , and expect to have to compromise a bit harder in order to make up for the little stunt that they did which is n't likely to happen , i 'd think
8	there was no meltdown in nebraska you forget that millions of people live right by those two plants trust me , there is no coverup that is even possible at that size or the ussr would have done it with things like chernobyl not to mention the people i know that live nearby and the nytimes covering it and the local news there covering it you 're just looking for disaster porn at this point
6	yes i have heard about nebraska 's power plant issues what now ?
8	there has not been a meltdown at the nebraska plant ( at least that any respected organization has reported ) the obama regime has ordered a total and complete news blackout relating to any information regarding the near catastrophic meltdown of the fort calhoun nuclear power plant located in nebraska even your sensationalized article states it was a near meltdown not a meltdown as stated in your headline the cooling of the nebraska plant went offline for an insignificant amount of time ( <> minutes ) and caused the cooling pool to rise by something like <> degrees ( f ) from <> to <> ( f ) the point ? meltdowns of this nature , in this type of reactor , require that the coolant boils off and subsequently exposes the fuel rods that happens at <> ( f ) the problem was fixed in an hour they could have probably had the cooling systems off for hours ( the reactor is apparently designed to run for <> hours with the cooling system offline ) and have been okay assuming a consistent increase of <> degrees ( f ) per hour , ( which of course is bad science math , but should give an idea of how much of a non event the fire was ) the plant would 've taken <> hours to overheat tldr op 's article has no mention of a meltdown actually occurring additionally , if the official story is true the reactor was no where near melting down edit fixed some typos
4	in all fairness , under clinton we had the dot com boom too boy , could we use something like that today <> <> companies were dumping cash into it to prevent the y2k bug and building new computer infrastructure ah , the good old days
4	lol
2	i'm starting to wonder if obama only has one butt cheek because everything he does is half assed
3	about time !
4	good
2	al sadr reminder who this guy is ( http www youtube com watch ? v x2ladpaes4g " the cleric , who is said to be in his <> , gained wide popularity among shi ' ites in iraq in the months after the us led invasion of <> and in <> his mahdi army militia battled us troops in two bloody conflicts known for the black " sayyid " and beard to match , the young cleric was identified by the pentagon in <> as the biggest threat to stability in iraq his militia became the most active and feared armed shi ' ite group , blamed by washington for death squad killings of thousands of sunnis " ) if you 've seen the documentary death squads ( http topdocumentaryfilms com dispatches the death squads ) , it 's about al sadr 's ethnical cleansing of sunnis in short , the guy 's grade a fucking scum and one of the worst war criminals in the iraq war
1	perhaps it 's the steady layoffs of public employees undercutting the demand in the economy ? perhaps what we don ' t need right now is more spending cuts ?
6	me i'm puzzled you still have a job mr bernanke
6	no kidding it 's a toss up between who has a better hit rate bernanke or colorado weathermen
3	ca n't be no codpiece
1	fuck , i am way to the left of obama and i saw it as a " mission accomplished " speech slightly more dignified than chimpy mcflightsuit
8	yeah and if it 's true imho it makes everyone involved look even worse , not just the two repubs he 's attacking in the article
3	but nor is it an accident that cantor is fleeing the room now that the spending cuts have been chosen and the taxes have to be agreed to for all the reasons that boehner needs cantor s fingerprints on the deal , cantor can t put them there it 's news to me that cuts have been agreed on
8	this is yet another war of conquest for the benefit of the big corporations that we the peeps pay for
6	?
4	do n't worry , he 's just a libertard
2	i fully expect these clowns to go bankrupt trashing each other in the primaries
2	totally misleading title , he did not deny <> <> happened , he simply proved without a shadow of a doubt that the official story is a complete load of bull shit anyone with an iq above <> understands this
2	troofers are so fucking dumb that even though this is critical of troofers i'm not going to encourage them with attention by upvoting
3	public sector unions and the tsa literally a combination of two horrible ideas
4	great , now we 'll never get rid of them
6	how come tsa gets a union but not walmart ?
2	great i ca n't even imagine what worse service from the tsa even looks like full on smirking and giggling during the groping ? the line is closed for our union designated <> hour lunch ? no tsa , so no flying on holidays ?
8	always good to see working class americans join a union it is good for all of us in the end thankfully , anyone not choosing the luxury of flying commercial never has to deal with these people so even if you are against them , you are free to avoid them thus making their searches and seizures not " unreasonable " as defined by the constitution
8	unionization is n't the problem with the tsa , and it wo n't add to the problem , since it 's very specific their searching procedures are unconstitutional and should be challenged here 's legislation that would help with that https secure aclu org site advocacy ? cmd display & page useraction & id <> & s subsrc <> tsa abuses & jservsessionidr004 kw2g3lrpd6 app226a
8	actually i think this could be the first step to a less strict tsa the union could file charges of forced sexual harassment because they are forced to touch someone they do n't want too
3	oh , no , we 'll be able to get rid of them , so long as three supervisors sign off on it , at least <> documented and un appealed complaints , spend <> months on paid leave status , have their firing approved by a panel of peers , and do n't have seniority
2	honestly im getting tired of the govt banning regulating controling every aspect of our lives
2	do n't get me wrong i agree that they are intruding way too much
1	the right to bare bath salts !
1	just because one thing is banned that should n't be , does n't mean that other things deserve the same treatment also , you do n't have a constitutional right to get high stated in the bill of rights
8	you dont have to have an assault rifle if you dont want one thats the law
1	because a lot of people do n't think we should have one it 's not a question of " can we , " but of " should we ? "
1	no , because when the founders said that " a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state " they meant that civilians must be allowed to own assault weapons to shoot squirrels , neighbors , and beer cans
1	no typical street thug criminal carries around an assault rifle most people who do have them have them legally and use them responsibly the biggest problem with guns is not the guns them self but the idiots who get their hands on them how about we just have a restriction on stupid people instead ?
8	i can say the same thing about the bath salts
2	well , at least their previous arguments could have possibly had a basis in fact like " gay marriange will make it easier for them to adopt kids and it is harmful to children to have <> same sex parents " there is no evidence for that but it was possible to determine whether that statement was true because it was not obviously illogical a priori like we did n't know whether that was true or not until people did studies or the statement , " god meant for only men and women to get married , and our laws should reflect the will of god " now i disagree with that but you can at least get behind the idea that ethics should be considered in law even if we disagree about what ethical system to use in this article , there is no appeal to any kind of hypothesis to test with any kind of evidence there is no philosophical debate to be had about what the law should or should not do he is just saying something that is blatantly false and hoping that because he used certain hot button words people will agree with him this tactic has been used before but not so extreme as to the point that if you speak english , you will know instantly that he is contradicting himself that 's a first for me
6	did they ever even have an argument ?
2	i 'd like to say americans wo n't fall for that kind of fear mongering , but history is against me
2	wolverines !
4	one of my favorite authentic adj youtube video and or blog or facebook update from activist in restive country for immediate broadcast
6	i thought diggers were the only one who thought they could get ron paul into office apparently the same retards have ported over here
2	yeah it sucks many people fled digg after the ron paul spam propaganda came to town it is heating up here again with their nonsense spam
2	the us has a military presence in some <> nations insanity
3	so , americans , how does it feel to be the new empire on which the sun never sets ? in all seriousness , this trend of setting up bases with large garrisons in nations all across the world is becoming pretty costly , and you rarely hear anyone mention the costs involved in running bases on almost ? every continent on the planet
6	and who set those bombs off , eh ?
5	yeah , it gets a little crazy here from time to time
4	ya that surge sure worked
2	we are preparing for ground war in libya and we are preparing to start shit in syria what is happening right now is they are relieving domestic pressures by releasing those gas reserves and acting like they are winding down troop levels only so they can do a greater military offense
6	so without debating how much you think a police officer needs to be paid before they 're held accountable by law , let 's get back to clarence thomas thomas should be , not chastised , but rewarded for seeking out new means of keeping the government afloat why ? what benefit does society gain by him accepting money from political interest groups ?
5	that is one of the dumbest things i have ever seen put into words
3	this is where it became obvious that you 're trolling for negative karma the government is broke it is necessary that we , as a society , find new and innovative methods of revenue collection to ensure that vital social services are not cut in any way
6	you 're being sarcastic , right ? how is that any different from cops accepting bribes ?
1	you 're actually saying as long as his votes fit his political position it 's okay for him to take gifts and not report his wife 's salary from people with interests in those rulings ! ? ! ? ! his job is to consider the facts of the cases and making impartial decisions putting all preconceptions and prejudices aside and if he cannot do that to recuse himself
4	thank you i will continue to monitor this as one of her constituents
5	actually , i tend to agree with you on that , and it 's a great disappointment all i can do , and try to do , as a voter is to support the most progressive candidates i can i try to research what they have voted on , where their money comes from , watch any speeches by them on cspan , stuff like that what else can we do ? i only have <> vote
5	yeah i wanted to add bernie , but technically i was responding about democrats ( i e members of the democratic party ) and technically bernie is not a democrat , he 's an independent a socialist actually who caucuses with the democrats
2	i think you 're an idiot because i need to get my dick enlarged in beverly hills ? that 's logical
1	also , let 's not forget let 's not forget , dude that keeping wildlife , an amphibious rodent , for uh , domestic , you know , within the city that ai n't legal either
1	he can get all the pubic hair he wants in prison
3	i think that lincoln bust aei link is a bit of a distraction aei just filed amicus briefs , which anyone with the money can do there are other issues that may have more relevance , but this ( and the silence from the bench ) really is n't one of them
1	racist !
2	yeah , he needs to go , as do scalia but they 're not going to , and no republican dominated congress is going to force them you can rail against the corruption of the scotus all you like , but i bet you that thomas will sit until the day he 's found dead in a motel room with a hooker
8	look , let me be clear if we as a society would pay peace officers their true market worth , then they would have no need to seek out other means of income
7	mr thomas is lucky there was no such thing as twitter when he was sexually harassing hill , or he 'd be chasing ambulances outside of muni court like the hack he is no , he 's a conservative judge so its okay for him to have values the shift with the wind
5	sorry but i'm too busy being outraged by government spending , those fatcat public workers and eating my big mac
2	i am a republican and i am disgusted by clarence thomas after reading this article no interest group should be able to buy a supreme court vote
5	you know that this will never happen because him resigning would mean that obama gets to swing the deciding vote on the scotus conservatives are going to defend thomas even if he was caught on tape killing someone
3	there really should be term limits for the scotus
8	you could have just as easily responded to clarify your comment rather than to attempt to be insulting that no one understands what you 're saying does n't mean you 're smarter than they are there 's another obvious possibility there
6	would it not be accurate to say , though , that most of the democratic party is bought and sold by corporate interests as well ?
2	i lol so fucking hard at you idealistic children that think your precious democratic party is pure as the driven snow ! trial lawyers , public unions , big record and recording , cable companies , wall street , big banks and many more own the democratic party do some simple research and pop your cherries to the fact that all of the us government is bought and paid for by special interest repbublican and democrat alike
4	ca <> hi five i'm pretty liberal , maybe not even to her extent but it really really feels like it 's a waste of my time writing her about issues because for the most part , i know she 's gonna do me right
6	no i was asking for the democrats who are not bought and paid for who are they ?
6	how about answering his question ?
6	so basically you 're saying that if he takes money from the teaparty it 's cool as long as he rules for the teaparty 's interests , but if he rules against the teaparty he should be investigated ?
3	i concur all of the people in office need to be removed , immediately
1	and he never disclosed that he donated it !
7	exactly in order for the supreme court to function in the best interests of society , it is necessary for them to be properly insulated from things that could affect their ability to do the job investigations and convictions would paralyze the entire judicial branch of government , and drain money and resources from the taxpayer we , as a society , have made the necessary decision grant thomas the necessary leeway if you ca n't grasp the concept , then either go take a civics class , or move to somalia
6	syntax error did you mean if ( party ofaccused r & & accountability means r ) boolean prosecution false
2	i disagree most of the problem is that the federal judicial code does not apply to the supreme court justices if they were held to the same standard as federal judges , thomas would have had to recuse himself in several cases so far alternatively , the penalties for " forgetting " to report the money his wife " earned " would force him out of his seat
4	you should watch the wire very interesting towards the <> and <> season with behind closed doors political games and such
8	and the republican senators would have to agree it takes a <> <> majority in the senate to remove an impeached official from office that 's not the filibuster , that 's written right into the constitution
1	no they may be impeached , but they may not be recalled there 's no such thing as recalling a federal official
8	i getcha and a uv worthy point cops currently can run side businesses if they want to i think , and if crack was legal i 'd be cool with them being able to sell it , because there would be no conflict of interest between their side business and the occupation they chose in service of the public that said i was using the cops selling crack thing as analogy for conflict of interest in professions like a cop being paid by a criminal to look the other way when a crime is committed
8	no thomas is a member of the government the government is broke it is necessary that we , as a society , find new and innovative methods of revenue collection to ensure that vital social services are not cut in any way thomas should be , not chastised , but rewarded for seeking out new means of keeping the government afloat
1	what the fuck is wrong with you ?
6	just apply ethics rules to supreme court if thy are ethical , no big deal , right ?
4	all the democrats from maryland , because we like it that way
6	how about boerner handing out checks on the house floor ? http www liveleak com view ? i d3a <>
2	haha wow ! they actually almost impeached somebody because they had a bias that affected their rulings ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! how far we have fallen
2	i 'd say it 's more that he can technically be impeached , but that will never happen to begin with the impeachment must start in the house which is currently run by republicans and will be until <> at the very earliest it is absolutely , <> , guaranteed they will not vote to impeach thomas but even if we assume by some miracle the house does vote to impeach it then takes a <> <> majority for the senate to remove thomas from office this is also absolutely , <> , guaranteed not to happen so basically it 'd take two separate acts of the republicans voting to impeach one of the younger ultra conservative justices and leave an opening that the evil commiefaggot secret muslim kenyan illegal " president " could fill i'm absolutely sure that thomas could , on live national television , accept one of those oversized checks from a person with a case pending before the court and the republicans would not vote to impeach him in fact , i would n't be surprised if he did just this to rub our noses in the fact that he will never , ever , be removed from office for his corruption hell , i'm fairly sure that thomas could commit murder on live national television and the republicans would not vote to impeach him
2	do n't kid yourself there are no honest politicians left true story
6	oh yeah ? name them
2	its ethics boards all the way down
2	that 's bad but it is n't treason it 's corruption
6	in order for the supreme court to function in the best interests of society , it is necessary for them to be properly insulated from things that could affect their ability to do the job would n't special interest money be one of those things they should be insulated from because it could effect the way a judge does their job ?
2	wow , what a pile of horse shit this is n't somalia we have granted thomas power to represent us if he fails to represent and rule in our interests , then he has failed to do his job and should be removed from his position
1	tough luck , he 's a republican he 's not going anywhere nor will he be convicted or even investigated for anything
4	bernie sanders , although officially an independent socialist , congressman jan schakowski to name <>
1	are you naive enough to think van jones was the only one ? the arrested protesters , including jones , won a small legal settlement jones later said that " the incident deepened my disaffection with the system and accelerated my political radicalization " <> jones said he was " a rowdy nationalist " <> before the king verdict was announced by august of that year , he said , " i was a communist " <> you mad ? you do n't like being called a racist ? you can turn on any cable news network and at least once an hour hear some whacked out liberal calling a conservative a racist if you even question the policies of obama you are called a racist so only you and your kind can spot racist ? only you and your kind are above racism ? reid and biden have made horrific racist statements about obama in the past but nope ! they ca n't be racist they are democrats only conservatives are racist ! ! im not playing any racial card i am just giving the self proclaimed intellectual dumb fucks a taste of their own medicine
2	nazis are showing up at mainstream right wing " tea party " political rallies , they are n't showing up at democrat events your argument is invalid
8	were you old enough to understand the case at the time ? it was all over the news and it was a huge televised scandal i'm pretty sure my mom called him a pervert after we heard the " there 's a pubic hair on my coke " quote no i was still a kid back then and did n't care about politics the only knowledge i have is from reading the various articles that have been written on it what actual evidence was there that thomas sexually harassed hill ? everything i 've read was anecdotal evidence from either side just as many people testified on behalf of thomas as against thomas why do you automatically assume guilt ? it 's not " slander and libel " , he 's using contributions illegally what money has he been given that he used illegally ? what specific law was broken ?
4	well played
8	barbara lee for one , and i do n't just say that because she is one of my representatives but she has really been an awesome progressive candidate and really looked out for the interests of the working class , the poor , and the oppressed in this country russ feingold comes to mind , that man was a staunch opponent of corporate interests lynn woolsey and pete stark from california who are in the progressive caucus ( all of whom are democrats ) are pretty amazing representatives who have fought corporate interests in congress raul grijalva from arizona comes to mind too
8	coexistence and non aggression do not harm another because they are " different " from you do not feel scared , frightened and under attack what is right is to accept and coexist with those who are different from you without calling them hateful names or attacking them in any way love conquers hate there is no more need for conflict conflict is what is not wanted peace , love , acceptance no calling someone a " racist " or a " pervert " and pronouncing your nature as objectively superior to theirs we can peacefully coexist with each other , there is no need for " revenge " that only brings more feeling of oppression and leads to those who attack being attacked back establish a dialogue with the others nature that does not judge or pronounce them a objectively " bad " do not harm do not harm do not engage is legal warfare for dominance over those different from yourself respect other natures and do not attempt to impose your own on them , in return they will respect you and not attempt to impose their nature on you imposing a foreign nature leads to feelings of oppression and hatred for those " oppressors " and then that leads to violence , death and destruction , pain and suffering do not punish , accept when the consciousnesses can accept each other as different without wanting to destroy each other then we can have a dialogue that does not create feelings of oppression and conflict
6	in all fairness it 's not like he went and sent pictures of his cock to consenting women he was having some kind of online kink fest with
2	in my opinion , he has no business sitting on the high court after the reprehensible treatment he forced anita hill to endure everybody should read a brief summary of the anita hill " scandal " here ( http en wikipedia org wiki clarence thomas supreme court nomination controversy over allegations and sexual harassment ) and also remember that most people who were around at the time supported thomas over anita hill this notion that thomas is a sexual deviant and harassed anita hill is n't grounded in reality or facts back to the matter at hand , if any of these left wing groups think thomas is acting illegally , they have the duty to take him to court and force the issue for impeachment by the senate anything less means they are just trying to slander and libel him
4	look , it 's fine it 's not like he showed his penis on twitter , and we all know how much that twitter picture influenced us policy s
2	clinton committed perjury hell , all politicians have something in their closet we keep the rest of them lemme know when you get some sense to get rid of all of them , then i 'll listen
2	i got to the part where it said " as has been stated , supreme court justices are exempt from following the judicial code of conduct " while i realized that the clause that allows him to file amendments to his finincial disclosures means that so long as he amends he is n't in violation of a law and stopped thinking about it if you want this to be true , i understand it 's good to want things better to campaign on an issue or against a person that you could actually hurt , with an actual isssue though
8	bet you guys wouldnt feel the same if a republican were in the white house to appoint the next one
6	i think i see the problem here may i suggest professional help ? ( http www beverlyhillssurgical com )
6	this is an instance of conservative corruption can you discuss this instance without changing the subject ? it seems that you are incapable
6	do you actually know what treason is ? do you understand how law works ?
2	with all due respect that makes no sense the constitution does not give the court the power to reexamine cases that have been decided and most if not all cases that were decided are no longer ripe and therefore do not present a " case or controversy " under article iii that is all before we get into all the parties who will need to reenter litigation since their case was decided based on precedent you 're suggesting we overturn on both the civil and the criminal side the costs of doing that are easily in the billions of dollars finally , " treason against the united states , shall consist only in levying war against them , or in adhering to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort " u s const art iii , <> that is not fulfilled here tl dr that 's an unconstitutional idea and even if it were n't it would still be a very bad one
2	no , he 's accused of lying by leftist kook websites who do n't have sufficient knowledge of the laws and rules governing supreme court justices to make that decision they 've been in full deflection mode since weiner got caught with his pants down
2	ughhh , sorry to inform you but most if not all our elected politicians are doing the exact same thing these people do n't care about you , they are in power to kept their friends rich and to get richer themselves capitalism , is a lie that america brought , and now we must reap what we sowed
6	what , like they strung him up with fiber optic cables ?
8	yep bunch of racist that believe no real black man can be conservative he must be an uncle tom ! these kids that think they are rightous progressives fuckin sicken me if they only knew the real racist , nazi loving roots of the progressive movement , they would fuckin throw up or maybe not
8	and also remember that most people who were around at the time supported thomas over anita hill were you old enough to understand the case at the time ? it was all over the news and it was a huge televised scandal i'm pretty sure my mom called him a pervert after we heard the " there 's a pubic hair on my coke " quote i would n't say anyone supported him , he was rather the beginnings of a new movement in massive policy change on sexual harassment , and an onslaught of lawsuits from many other similar cases clarance thomas set the mold for sexual harassment back then , they did n't even know how to pronounce " harassment " , they said " hair ' ess ment " it 's not " slander and libel " , he 's using contributions illegally
6	if party of accused r and means of accountability r then prosecution false republicans will close ranks around their own , criminal or otherwise to impeach him , the republican house would have to vote for the rule of law over the rule of republicans
5	true that i just figured i 'd add my two cents good luck against the troll
3	of all things at risk for the <> elections this needs to be stressed as a huge point talk to every candidate and get a promise to impeach him
2	these justices are n't elected , and are not politicians if he 's acting like a politician , then he should resign
5	look , let me be clear political interest groups are also part of society ( " people " , if you will ) you seem heck bent on discriminating against those particular people , and that is just plain bigotry
6	why should a justice be a lifelong held job ? there is no rhyme or reason for this , except a self serving one
2	it is necessary for them to be properly insulated from things that could affect their ability to do the job like undisclosed political donations
1	he betrayed us citizens for the interests of a corporation i do n't think that 's different from betraying us citizens for another nation , sorry if you do the point is that he is a cancer and should be removed ( or irradiated )
8	he 's just pointing out that by the articles extremely obvious bias against conservatism makes it lose credibility when talking about the issue at hand
1	he has betrayed the citizens of the united states of america he did it for himself instead of another nation but in one of the highest offices of this country he betrayed the people who have no choice but to trust him that 's pretty treasonous he does n't have to sell nukes to russia to qualify he sold us out to corporate interests instead
8	aid and comfort to the corporate enemies of the people every single case he has been a part of is pretty much unconstitutional now , by the way he is n't supposed to put the interests of anyone but the law and the citizens into his decisions his betrayal indicates that there were many cases that might have been decided differently if he had followed his oath and duty to the people obviously we ca n't just reverse all those but every single case where his vote was a tipping point should have the option of being retried
6	so why is it a big deal if he is accepting what would normally be illegal gifts ? well , any party that appears before him has to wonder if his opinion was already purchased by the other side it leads to our inability to rely on " justice "
2	so he " forgot " to report <> if i forget to tell my wife i slept with another woman , i'm not cheating right ? i just " forgot " ? edit i would also like to add that it was n't until weiner started challenging thomas on this that his " issues " even got brought to light i do n't know if it was a hit job or if it was just a coincidence , but it is awfully cute timing
1	that article lost all credibility with the line " consevative corruption is nothing new in washington dc " no , fuckwit , corruption is nothing new in washington dc if you 're going to pretend that it 's only a conservative thing or even that conservatives are more guilty of it than liberals , then your work is meaningless most of these sons of bitches in office are corrupt both parties do n't be a fucking child
6	it 's weird he 's lying and getting away with it not to mention the conflict of interest stuff which most lawyers take pretty seriously but apparently not the ones that argue before the supreme court
2	every single case he has heard should be reexamed without his vote if that means some cases get re decided the other way , so be it he 's a corrupt piece of shit that deserves nothing less than to be charged with treason
3	as one of the posters to this article pointed out , if there was any chance that thomas was actually breaking the law , our attorney general would look into it maybe he is and just has n't made it public yet
1	well , he 's no roger b taney , but he 's still a terrible justice
1	where does he live i ' ll fix it
6	all we need are some underwear pic now and i 'll support this <>
3	i can only imagine this is planned and the monster he is replaced with will only speed up the destruction of this country
2	the main reason is so they do n't have to worry about political retribution for decisions that go against the powers that be they are free to follow the law with out worrying about getting fired for pissing someone off obviously if they are bought and paid for , that goes out the window along with all other accountability
6	silly kid who ever said you are included in ' we ' ?
2	i think what we should be asking is who is the least beholden because quite frankly i think most members of both parties have ties that guide their thinking the american system is corrupt and broken generally in my opinion and to find someone clean would be almost impossible
1	raul grijalva is a motha fucking badass ! fact check bitches http www votesmart org voting category php ? can id <> how can we as enabled citizens support more representatives like this man and garner support to overthrow our status quo of republican and democrats ? i vote green party cause they 're the most aligned with my worldviews however i know tons of people that are not aware of them or are n't willing to investigate alternatives at all we should be able to channel our might into the fury of angry citizens come let us brainstorm a way to become one mighty force of checks and balances against corruption and corporatocracy ! srsly , we need to come together it 's the only way , how can we do this ?
5	my apologies for taking you at your words rather than trying to read your mind to find the vague context implied by a username from an earlier post
1	shit dude , i see what you 're saying , but ca n't you look at your post and see how it was kinda vague and easily misinterpretted ? way to go from <> to dick in no time flat
6	there 's a difference between supporting israel as a generality and being backed by aipac which pretty much every american politician is
8	sure they should crack should be legal , and cops ( if they choose ) should be allowed to run side businesses
2	it was in the same thread , and obvious sarcasm i apologize that your brain does not function above a third grade level and ca n't keep track of simple conversations
3	but then the whole system will collapse !
5	the supreme court should be held to a higher standard this is the body that is the final arbiter of law in the u s and it 's members receive lifetime appointments there must some sort of check on egregious behavior like this
2	i do n't mean to single out republicans particularly , but you do realize that most of your party is bought and paid for by corporate and special interests ? not saying that this does n't happen among democrats , but there are at least some in the democratic party who are not wholly owned by their corporate backers
6	wait , so the constitution doesnt make provisions for how to impeach a supreme court justice ? huh and you know whats not in the constitution judicial review
8	it 's not about thomas , though your supreme court needs a very clear ethics board that can apply horrible penalties currently , there are zero non voluntary measures short of congress impeachment honestly , an ethics board should be feared justices should be terrified of ethics violations they ought to be " oh god , please do n't let the ethics ' rottweiler eat my testicles " penalties ought to be epic , given the status of the court like fire or acid a slow , public dissolving might give a man pause
2	thomas not only will sell his ass for a dollar he will sell yours for <> cents
2	you people are so na ve , every single year your senators and even lower grade politicians receive hundreds of thousands of dollars to " consider " some arguments about some votes with a " keen " eye
6	we do n't even need a supreme court why do we let a bunch of lawyers in robes dictate what the laws of our people should be ? screw that we do n't need to put up with it
6	what crime did she commit ?
2	to quote from billy madison " what you 've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling , incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points , and may god have mercy on your soul "
6	is it possible to recall a supreme court justice ?
3	we needed him gone before he got there
1	clarence thomas is an asshole , but it would be incorrect to call him stupid , as the author in the linked article did he is extremely intelligent i have to wonder if the author , or anyone condemning the guy , has actually read any of his published opinions , dissents , concurrences , etc you may disagree with his judicial philosophy , and his ethics , but branding him as a " vapid intellectual presence " who " has n't had an original thought since his shameful senate approval " would be a mistake you can find his writings here http www law cornell edu supct author php ? thomas
6	you have ( falsely ) assumed that it should be any different police officers face delicate scenarios every day situations that you , the average citizen , does not have the training and experience to know how to handle look , let me be clear there are too many laws on the books as such , we as a society must give peace officers the ability to use their best judgement
6	might want to read that in context " his " stoopidflanders is this digg ? should i explain every post ?
6	might want to read that in context " his " stoopidflanders is this digg ? should i explain every post ?
3	read the comment i wrote above barbara lee , lynn woolsey , pete stark , raul grijalva , all have consistently voted progressive causes , and against corporate interests when those interests were perceived to be harmful to the middle class and working poor in this country those are just a few , there are probably more it 's interesting that the progressive caucus in congress does not have any republican members just saying
3	i thought bernie sanders sold out to the banks
2	i agree , all politicians are brought and paid for by some corporation , its like we are the caldari state in eve hell , obama is brought and paid for by corporate interests just look at the differences of senator obama and president obama
3	because , if we did n't have it , then it would be god 's rule and if you have read the bible you see how that went
2	please , just be quiet with all this leftist and rightie babble we here enough of this shit on the news , on the radio , and in everyday life if you really want to say anything , how about you admit to yourself all these mfers are corrupt and should be in prison or better yet be sent to fight the wars they started
8	there have been no communists anywhere near the us government next time , you will be less embarrassed if you learn the meanings of words by looking them up in a dictionary before you start bleating them in public clarence thomas ' race has nothing to do with it whatsoever your attempt to play the racial persecution card is pathetic to the point of self parody
4	wow , you have an uncanny ability to say lots of things that are n't true kudos !
6	really ? downvoted ? the article does n't mention criminal violations so i am honestly curious what crime she committed
2	you must be a conservative sent to try to misinform us , just like your ideas about intelligent design ah , this guy sexually harassed a women without her consent , i happen to think that is worse then sending a penis pic
1	nope , he only sexually harassed non consenting women
6	where did race come into the discussion ?
8	there are at least some in the democratic party who are not wholly owned by their corporate backers love to hear some names all i can think of is kucinich
6	yes , but who watches the watchmen ?
2	nope he stays and is one of the votes that will rid us of the nation killing obama care bill after that you racist can get rid of him first rule of the interwebs never believe everything you read on the internet especially from some no name fringe leftist rag if this was all true , do n't you think the leftist communist who currently occupy portions of our government would be raising hell to get him out ? these are just racist leftist that ca n't stand that a black man uncle tom has a conservative bent trust me , if this was some whack leftist , they would think he is god
1	ginni is freaking koo koo significant clarence thomas a biography ( http www amazon com gp product <> ? ie utf8 & tag polidebanews <> & linkcode xm2 & camp <> & creativeasin <> )
6	see the common greeks taking to the streets
5	and world 's poorest are less informed , less concerned and more apathetic than ever before so it 's a win win situation the rich get disgustingly and absurdly richer the poor get to wallow around in their ignorance , apathy and misery sounds about right
3	many countries are making simultanious moves i read a few days ago it has to do with busting the oil speculaters who were causing iran to have scary amounts of cash
6	authorities have said the turmoil in libya has resulted in a loss of about <> <> million barrels of oil a day so that 's why we are there
4	nice editorializing on the headline , karma whore
6	how many times would the entire food stamp program fit into the pentagon budget ?
2	yoo should die from choking on his own vomit preferably , today
2	bolton is an evil man he is not qualified to be dogcatcher maybe the guy that shoots the cattle in the head at the slaughterhouse , but nothing more influential than that
2	probably because nobody can stand to be in a room with him long enough
6	are you telling me that mitch mcconnell is n't a serious politician ?
2	all politicians are actors in the theatrical sense
6	are you telling me that mitch mcconnell is n't a hypocrite ?
2	guess the farmers and the markets will have to raise the price on suppressed wages
5	no , looks more likely they will raise the price of food
8	do not harm others do not do harm to them no one harm anyone else things will be peaceful
8	agreed we have been supporting a suppressed market all around
6	what difference would annual limits on purchases make ? that seems unreasonable not like any of it seems reasonable , but would we be safer if we made a law that only allowed people with dui 's to buy one car a year ?
5	" it is time that the president cut ties with the plutocrats " funniest thing i 've read this week ! good one !
3	depends on who you 're talking about though if they are anything like my mom , who is blaming all of what the gop is doing on obama without being able to cite how she came to such a conclusion , then all it would do would be to cement those opinions further there are just some people who are so far gone or disconnected that it does n't matter what happens , it 's going to be his fault , and all of the accomplishments are going to be credited to the gop
2	i agree with the sentiment , but the article linked to is not very well written
6	funny how this question and question about greeks protesting austerity measures , relate
4	i like how he says the republicans want to tax the middle class to balance the budget i found that kind of funny
4	that is the sole function of faux news
8	spending your way out of recession seems logical
5	with bernanke clueless about why doubling the deficit in <> years has n't improved the economy can we finally put the keynesian model to bed it is ridiculous to think deficit spending in the capitalist sector toward new technology versus deficit spending on temporary social programs and the back logs of too big too fail international businesses would result in the same outcome most on the right already know this but the left seems to believe they are too intelligent to realize spending on new technology results in marked ip advancement spending on social programs , backlogs and shovel ready projects means you are right back where you started we are at the least , on the worlds most expensive economic experiment with debt
3	i think that this does have an important bearing on social issues but i think the underlying point of this article is even more important when it comes to financial issues we as a country need to recognize that we have to make a compromise somewhere we need to both increase revenue and decrease spending trouble is about <> <> of the budget is non discretionary spending made up of <> components <> military <> social security <> medicare medicaid its time to end tax cuts its time to end huge farm subsidies its time to reduce the size of the military its time to make tough choices
1	the more poorly allocated gop funding the better please sarah palin announce your candidacy ! !

6	hope griffin attends the erotic coprophage , necorphilia and the other victimless sexual fetishes enjoyed by less than <> of the population ( not that there 's anything wrong with it ) rallies otherwise she 's a bigot wonder if she 's stopped beating her wife yet , or did she grow into it ?
1	you missed my point where did i say gays are n't real people ? what i'm saying is who gives a fuck what some small interest group finds erotic if you like to eat shit or if you find peoples assholes sexually attractive , feel free if you want to call me a bigot for finding that distasteful and not choosing to celebrate it with you , go ahead
2	because gays are a minority and minorities are n't real people and the greatest country in the world needs a boogeyman story to lash out against weak
8	for me the govt should have no part in sanctioning marriage , period it 's an unnecessary power , used to discriminate for tax purposes and to support social engineering geared toward making for a compliant herd bachman sees the minority homosexual lifestyle with the same jaundiced eye that homosexuals might see even smaller minority sexual deviancies such as analingus , bestiality or necrophilia , which was the point of my op these perverts might consider it their " right , " and probably it is as long as they do no harm why not have masturbation pride parades ? everyone does it , but no one is particularly proud really all sexual behavior is pretty gross when you think about it stinky , slimy hedonistic escapism no subject for pride parades or rallies for anyone
6	michele bachmann does more than just find it unappealing she is part of a political machine that opposes gay rights she speaks out against gays and refers to their lifestyle as " bondage " and " sexual dysfunction " she treats gay issues like a boogeyman she actually has a member of her immediate family who is sexually out and practising lesbian , but bachmann does n't acknowledge her anymore griffin was not calling her a bigot based on her not wanting to attend a rally , she was speaking to her record i think most gay people have to get really good at oral sex , i dont think its exactly all about the anal penetration sometimes i wonder how amazing a gay mans mouth would feel on me do you ever wonder if a girl is better at giving oral to a girl than a guy is ? do you start with the clitoris or do you tease the inside folds of her labia and then work up to the clitoris ? just saying
5	victim here i was pulled over in fort paine , alabama on my way back from mardi gras they found less than a quarter ounce in my car i was <> at the time and in my freshman year of college the state troopers tore up my car seats and broke my console they cut my necklace off with a knife , i was strip searched , cavity searched , sprayed with a hose , and thrown in the " bull pen " overnight there were no beds left so i had to sleep on a mat on the floor i was sick for several days from sleeping on the cold floor , had to borrow <> from a friend to post bail , then walked <> miles to the impound lot to retrieve my car if i were a lesser man it would have scarred me for life i'm now <> and occasionally smoke to relax and relieve anxiety gg , war on drugs
8	and that 's just the tip of the iceberg , but its probably the reason the atf is selling guns to mexican drug cartels to help pay the bill to incarcerate people in possession of a plant
1	bullshit cough cough cough cough
8	pretty absurd for simple possession , right ? that 's what i thought too at the time
8	which is good , since if the difficulties are larger than anticipated , they can temporarily slow down pulling out , instead of trying to force a hard line on it but he can still try to get as much of a withdraw as possible in the mean time if it was n't gradual , then he would n't be able to deal with those sort of circumstances as well it also makes it easier on the troops themselves , since they are n't just leaving power vacuums which the ones left have to mop up either
2	the point is that your stupid reference to his heritage debases your argument and you weak rebuttal just piles more bullshit onto a stupid , worthless comment but thanks for contributing to the conversation , genius
6	weird my downvote worked for your propaganda laced comment
6	let 's see how long till the us is placed on a credit rating decline watch ?
6	since when has the constitution stopped congress or the president ? unless the existing constitution and bill of rights are followed , any new amendments are meaningless
6	ok , so let me see if i got this straight we have to wait for a new amendment to be ratified before the rebumblicans will raise the debt ceiling which they did a dozen times under bush how many years did the last amendment we tried to ratify , the equal rights amendment , flail and languor going from state to state to be voted on by <> <> of the general assemblies ? and they want to delay raising the debt by years cantor is the bar none dumbest man in washington at least he proves that not all jews are smart
1	if we 'd get the fuck out of the middle east and stop fighting god damned wars all the time , our economy might not be so fucking bad
2	calling it a balanced budget amendment is extremely dishonest , and borderline criminal , especially since its provisions do nothing to ensure that you actually produce a balanced budget at all , but instead caps spending at <> gdp that 's right if the federal government takes in more than that , they simply ca n't utilize it at all which means should they actually try to pay off debt at all , it eats into the <> gdp cap , since it 's spending , and takes away from what the government can do in fact , we 'd barely be able to keep medicare and social security at that rate , and everything else would have to get shut down this is n't about balancing the budget , but establishing spending caps as such , it 's very dishonest with its naming
4	yeah , it was pretty antisemitic of me to suggest that jewish people are smart or to point out that this is well known stereotype that seems not to hold true in cantor 's case i guess i'm just like people who burn down synagogues no different at all thanks for painting all of us antismites with the same broad brush it really keeps the meaning of the word antisemitism focused on the real problem oh , and do n't point out that irish people are sarcastic that would be anticelticism
4	as a steadfast rule government will spend every dollar it extorts , then keep on spending a constitutional limit on the size of government is a good idea
2	they should raise the tax to <> <> a gallon , i am sure then the roads would be fixed
1	hell why not <> ? imagine how awesome the roads would be then !
5	i think that 's an overly exaggerated statement i consider myself somewhat liberal i stay away from those labels , and i am constantly arguing on reddit that this country can thrive on lower taxes i personally believe the current tax system amounts to a scam on the american people i did n't vote for obama , and before he was elected warned he would continue many bush doctrines that democrat supporters hated i do n't believe the state should be in the business of providing direct care for the people ( social programs ) but that the people should provide those for themselves but , i do believe in bill of rights and allowing people to live their lives the way they want i believe in liberty , the root of liberalism they way you use the term , it sounds like democrats exercise liberalism , yet most do n't because they submit and vote for legislation that limits individuals liberties , along with most republicans you need to stop listening to hannity and the hippo crit rush limball and realize that there are worthy democrats out there , and that the bad ones are pushing for the same endgame as the bad republicans
6	<> per gallon ? hah !
4	tyl that in poland it 's roughly <> , <> per gallon and opening a new highway is a national grade event be happy that you still keep your liberals in check
5	i feel for you bro here in michigan i find a sense of relief crossing the border into ohio where the roads do n't rattle the shit out of my center console really the only thing for me to look forward passing into ohio oh , and cedar point
8	i work for the government , i am familiar with the gas tax roads are very expensive to maintain there is also a lot of them the tax in your instance its <> <> goes to a state fund , then gets distributed to local governments to improve the roads so its a process based on how well traveled the road is , to get it repaved or repaired bases on the allotted funds that year to the respective government agency
4	haha <>
1	those god damn poor people stealing food !
5	in mn , one of the rules is that you have to be working at least <> hours a week to get them so if you are unemployed for a long time , you 're screwed i was out of work for about three months , and during that time i ate dandelion greens , wild garlic , and whatever i could find in dumpsters ( which was itself illegal , but what was i going to do ) supplemented by occasionally spending a tiny amount of my saved cash on a bargain bin thing
1	maybe the wsj should do a story about banking and wall street fraud and how it has cost the world economy trillions of dollars no screw that lets pick on poor people besides the states make the rules as to how and who get food stamps i know of some states where if you have a bank account with <> in it and a <> car , you do not qualify for food stamps , basically meaning you have to be desperately poor to get help
8	do n't be so hard on the wsj the first sentence in the article says , " millionaires are now legally entitled to collect food stamps as long as they have little or no monthly income "
6	which states ?
4	the odds are stacked against it , but let 's try and remain optimistic and do what we can
2	bad teeth have been running rampant in this country for years
2	but that 's the country we 've created ! and people get the government they rightly deserve if americans would have been active and vocal and stayed informed about the banking crisis , we could have made sure that these people were thrown in prison and reforms put into place what did americans do ? yawn and flip the channel then curse obama or bush ( pick your side ) under their breath these people robbed americans blind and there was n't even a loud enough voice to be heard from the idle masses
2	you mean when a shit for brains eco jackass commits fraud he goes to jail good , i hope he receives lots of interracial prison anal sex
2	which is why i support the government selling off all of our federal , state , and local parks ( those that they own ) to firms such as the audubon society rather than let our wildlife be subject to the whim and varies of politicians and the next budget crisis , they should be subject to the whims of people who actually care about the environment and are incentivized to keep it clean and healthy
2	the educational system and mass media has turned the masses into brainless consumers do you expect them to beable to unlearn their childhood ? it is the job of the people who have been able to escape the american mindset to push the society in the right direction
4	rofl well done !
8	actually met an afghani once , said the people in kabul are pretty terrified of what will happen if we leave afghanistan various extremist groups still hold most of the south , so much so that if you 're at all affiliated with the government the area is unsafe for you to even travel through , and a network of sunni madrassas in pakistan are doing pretty heavy recruitment folks send their kids off , knowingly or not , and the kids come back with pretty militant views fuck michael moore i'm not crazy about war but it sounds like our presence is the only thing that country from collapsing into another bloody power struggle

6	i recently posted this on my facebook not expecting much in terms of opposition , but one of my old high school friends made a surprising claim half the population does n't pay taxes the top <> pct account for <> pct of the taxes so because people who were smart and earned their insane wealth by playing smart , they should have to pick up the slack of the rest of the country i responded to his comments with this article and by saying that being rich does n't necessarily make one smart and being poor does n't make one lazy and a few other points i am pretty set in my beliefs but if someone thinks that the rich need even more taxes breaks , please explain because it makes no sense to me whatsoever
2	i totally agree with you ! i hate the fact that the republicans refuse to even debate this issue taking away the horrible policies of reaganomics and the bush take cuts could really boost the economy
6	is this serious ? can you name one good reason why they would n't ?
5	schadenfreude shame on me
6	is his name a cock joke ?
1	why did the msm care more about weiner than vitter ? because well , i have no idea it might have something to do with the fact fuck it i have no idea

8	large cuts in the defense budget are probably impossible because of bi partisan opposition to those cuts libya is a very tiny <> billion dollars in mostly maintenance and supply costs
6	think about it when cantor says " republicans have made clear that we will not agree to raise the debt limit without real spending cuts " what he is doing is forcing democrats to propose cuts now if the democrats really had any progressive or leftward principles left , the answer would be simple " sure , we 'll cut defense spending and tax cuts for the rich " of course , obama has just led the way to war in libya and re upping the rich tax cuts , so that 's not gonna happen but suppose it did where is all the campaign money the democrats need going to come from ? or democrats could cut social programs and alienate their base ( what 's left of their base ) tl dr cantor says you 're fucked and he ca n't hold in the giggles

2	the real reason is to crash the economy 's of oil producing nations , making them fall into revolution and cease their production , then when the regime change has succeded , place a puppet pro western leader in power , and raise gas prices to new highs target iran
8	wont do shit , there isnt a shortage there is too much speculation
2	the problem with the costs at the pump is n't the amount of oil available in the world there 's still enough to meet current demand , even if we 're at peak production the problem is that the oil companies have created a bottleneck in their ability to refine it , and they refuse to build more that 's what 's artificially inflating our fuel prices
6	yay for the private sector !
5	haha , he thinks that prisons are for rehabilitation that 's what people like to say but prisons are basically to keep those people away from the rest of society in an ideal world prison would be to rehabilitate people but in today 's world not so much
2	you 're super naive or a troll
1	for profit prisons have no reason to rehabilitate they have every incentive to create an environment that fosters criminality so that they get repeat business after inmates serve their time that 's the best way to increase value for shareholders and it 's one of many reasons why for profit prisons are a fucking terrible idea
1	no , i'm in spain we 're fucked up here , but at least we do n't have private prisons ( yet )
8	this is why i am put in the curious position of fully supporting for profit prisons people with socio societalogical problems fully deserve the opportunity to receive the necessary rehabilitation that is provided to them , free of charge , for the duration of their stay there is a strange disconnect between the first and second sentences there there is absolutely no incentive for for profit prisons to help rehabilitate prisoners their customers are states , not prisoners , and they rely on a steady influx of inmates to ensure their revenue their incentive is therefore to have prisoners released come back as soon as possible , and for them to get the longest possible prison sentences by comparison , aside from the retarded " tough on crime " mentality of some countries ( the us of course , but france as well ) , the reasoned incentive for society as a whole ( therefore state controlled prisons ) is to rehabilitate and reintegrate inmates as productive members of society as soon as possible it lowers the draw on taxpayer money and increases the society 's productivity and work capacity now of course reason and voters tend not to match well , but the core incentive for for profit prisons still run exactly opposite of rehab
6	haha , he thinks that prisons are for rehabilitation in more socially sensible countries than the us , they are indeed some of norway 's prisons , like bast y ( the one of moore 's sicko ) make you almost want to be incarcerated once a prison colony for young boys , the facility now is trying to become " the first ecological prison in the world " inmates are housed in wooden cottages and work the prison farm during their free time , inmates have access to horseback riding , fishing , tennis , and cross country skiing and rehabilitation is definitely a major goal and purpose of all norwegian prison fwiw , norway 's biggest prison house only <> here is the a times article on the recently opened second biggest in the country prison , halden ( http www time com time magazine article <> , <> , <> , <> html ) with a capacity of <>
1	i do n't fuckin ' know how can anyone still say that america is home of the free with a straight face when you have private prisons seriously , you people are fucked
4	lobbying is a wonderful thing , who needs voting !
3	private prisons are the most frightening manifestation of the extreme ' free market ' principle it 's like privatising the army or the police force the justice system is such an important part of our society that no part of it should ever be in private hands prisoners have committed crimes against society and it should be collective society that punishes them not private corporations the fact that a company 's stock will go up the more people they lock up is orwellian
1	in theory when the public pays to jail someone , they have a vested interest in rehabilitating them , and getting them out of prison and off the taxpayers dime when private companies own and operate prisons , they have every incentive to keep the prisons full wtf america ? ?
3	private prisons weird me out i can tolerate our capitalism 's unfortunate effects on our creative endeavors ( music industry ) and our spiritual health , but a business that is more successful the more people are in prison has got to be some kind of a low point for us
2	yep ! deriving profit from the incarceration of others or generating revenue from violations of laws is odious and just results in incentive to put more laws on the books for people to be found in violation of , as we 're seeing welcome to police state <> and it 's companion course corruption <>
2	since the emancipation of slaves , prisons have used themselves as a loophole to continue the practice of slave labor
6	are you in the uk ? we have private prisons in the uk too as well as private police whoever thinks this shit up is beyond redemption
8	as a liberal , i understand that profits are only acceptable when they are made by helping people this is why i am put in the curious position of fully supporting for profit prisons people with socio societalogical problems fully deserve the opportunity to receive the necessary rehabilitation that is provided to them , free of charge , for the duration of their stay
2	during my little vacations over the years i 've often seen a rooms full of cops trying to figure out how to get pictures off of their digital cameras cops are stupid and the government is cheap put it together and you get fail
1	they can also just snatch your phones gps data without a warrant without a single fuck being given hell cops can run people down in the street and get off scott free imagine what the feds are up to ? <>
1	i was going to say they 're dumbasses for thinking sb1070 is a bad law , but that too they 've done more good than bad so far imo , but to say sb1070 is racist ( in a negative way ) is silly
1	the fact that people think lulzsec is an activist group is sad the fact that redditors who should know better think they are is sadder they 're not activists they are just fucking with people to create a sense of distrust of social institutions it 's embarrassing that people eat up their paper thin hypocrisy and champion it you give a sense of credibility to people who deserve none , for things they are n't doing nothing they 're doing is activism they 've been the first ones to admit that precisely what they are not and yet , you add perceived morality to the vacuum and thank an anonymous power with no checks for something that they are n't doing , even by accident morons
2	yes indeed now they need to hack into the federal reserve and release all the secret bank bailout bullshit and show proof of just how corrupt that sector really is to all the non believers
8	unfortunately , they 've lost a lot of the gaming communities support after hacking bethesda and taking down eve and minecraft
3	it was coming either way look up hbgary look up operation payback i'm sure i'm going to get downvoted to hell for saying this but only by people to lazy to find out what 's even going on this started with wikileaks and it ends with the fate of the free world
1	i really enjoy that everyone is raising their voice about lulzsec being some lowbie group of hackers but no one has taken the time to prove so fuck even if they are , why does it even matter ? does that discredit them somehow ? have they ever come out and said that they were some super elite group ? nope the fact is that they are acting while others are n't if it 's so easy then other people would be to and do n't reply with " but its against the law ! ! ! " well they have n't been arrested yet because they are doing it right so apparently there is no reason other people cant as well right ?
2	a lot of hate and violence spewing from your posts there
6	i'm liking this new era of activism i think the world needs more of it in order to keep the powers to be in check
6	the important question that will probably get buried under the media rhetoric why do law enforcement agencies and governments , in this day and age , not properly secure their info systems ? some of the 's ecurity efforts ' that have been ' hacked ' in the past few weeks border on negligent
6	did anyone see the picture of the suv with the <> cal in the back of it ?
2	well they do have some anonymity when their riot masks are down , badges hidden , and they 're just hitting smacking dragging people in a peaceful protest crowd
2	i agree if there 's nothing wrong going on , then there 's nothing to hide public servants should be held in scrutiny by the public , every action should be accountable the fact that public servants want their actions and intentions hidden from the public belies their contempt for the public that they serve
6	lulzsec leaks arizona law enforcement papers lulzsec leaks ?
6	why not hit two birds with one stone ? catalogue people 's access to the international citizen 's information services and charge them money to do it ?
6	who does n't , at this point ?
2	yes , all cops are spineless evil villains none of them joined the force to do the right thing none of them are working there because they want to make a difference , nor working to get a paycheck to support a family ( because cop benefits are pretty decent for jobs that do n't require a college diploma ) for a community that touts itself on being intelligent , diverse , and accepting , i have seen few other organizations completely demonize an entire profession quite as swiftly and callously as reddit has done with police officers i understand that there 's corruption in the system , and that there are a lot of bad people who are given power that should n't have it that does n't allow you to endanger everyone involved because you 're angry ps i 'll be honest , i was pretty distraught by what you wrote so i started reading through your comment history seriously , supporting the rioters in vancouver ? " i'm cool with theft so long as it 's from a big business ? " i do n't mean to make this into an ad hominem , but seriously what set you off to indiscriminately hate every organization of authority ?
5	true we need to start considering information security as important as physical security that is the way the world has moved for a government to shell out billions on planes , ships , and overseas contractors is absurd when the same government wo n't hire an it guy in each data driven office for <> <> yr
6	first of all , still waiting on that info ( also , if it 's so easily available on google then why not just give it to us ? ) a you could come to my house and shoot me , rape me , vandalize my house or my car , rob me , stalk me , harass me , prank call me , send me spam emails , hack into my email , stalk my family , harass my family that enough ? b having something available on google and releasing cops ' information very publicly are totally different things c are cops not required to identify themselves if asked ? even if not , then this is something you should take up with your legislature , not by compromising the safety of individual officers i have two problems with your last point one , if it 's so bad then move out of arizona seriously , people are more mobile now than ever before two , it does n't make sense how does knowing a police 's home address let you " police the police ? " it does n't , unless you 're willing to kill them , in which case , see my point a
2	police can ask me for my address and put me in jail for not answering them i think there 's nothing wrong with holding them to the same standard it 's the perfect opportunity to put the age old cop question " if you 've got nothing to hide then why are n't you cooperating ? " so , cops , if they have nothing to hide then they should have no fear of this information going public
2	this is true the blame for sb1070 lies on arizona legislators and arizonans who supported it it was unpopular among the police themselves
3	i'm not sure what you 're saying here the police could easily track me , so i am not enjoying anonymity furthermore , i am not exempt from the law thanks to the " blue code of silence "
7	a i have no method of oppressing you , a policemen does b these potential oppressors have every ability to get these things , hell you could if you used google c policemen are under no real threat of retaliation from the populous , as we are unable to go request information , a warrant , or even an address about them given these things , the only way people actually have of policing the police and watching the watchers is if they are given the same info as a resident of arizona , where the law enforcement is particularly heinous for a number of reasons , i do n't give a rats ass if your anonymity has been compromised , because ours already is
2	chaotic evil chaotic evil is referred to as the " destroyer " or " demonic " alignment characters of this alignment tend to have no respect for rules , other people 's lives , or anything but their own desires , which are typically selfish and cruel they set a high value on personal freedom , but do not have any regard for the lives or freedom of other people they do not work well in groups , as they resent being given orders , and usually behave themselves only out of fear of punishment after their " titanic take down tuesday " and releasing all those passwords , that definition seems to apply
2	which line of yours is sarcastic ? you might be confusing sarcasm with gallows humor and i'm prettty sure you 're the creepy one , trenchcoat boy
1	nope it works ! http www merriam webster com dictionary sheepish
6	you know how we hold people accountable in the united states of america ? laws elections how 's that working out for jose guerena ?
2	when the entire system is broken steps need to be taken outside of it in order to create real change the extent of change needed is probably where we differ i think it 's time for a revolution , and revolutions by their very nature cannot occur from working with the despots in control lulsec ( even though many are n't american ) are the true patriots in this day and age it should also be noted that wikileaks had a team of people looking over all the information released so as to not put american troops in danger they also released the information through respected journalists who could give more information on a story since the frame up of assange , and his house arrest ( without charges ) is now entering <> days it should be expected that other groups will take up the fight for transparency since they turned assange into a criminal they 've now created many smaller groups willing to fill the void it 's the same backward approach the us takes in its global war on drugs , take out one cartel and then watch the violence spread the us made this shit bed and now they have to lie in it lulzsec are only the first , and this will never end so law enforcement must get used to the hackers having the upper hand
4	i appreciate you taking the time to craft a long , rational post while i ca n't help but disagree with the majority of your second paragraph , i admire you for it
4	yes holding every public official , and especially those elected , is the only way to run a proper government anything less and you 're descending into a fascist dictatorship inch by inch the more scrutiny public servants come under , the better job they will do
4	i 've understood everything it 's you who keeps reeling from exposure now you conflate a desire to expose corruption with " want ing to see the world burn " such rationalizations can lead to evil acts honestly , i'm sorry i teased you i hope you can connect with someone and talk about these things in person
5	a not without retaliation from the police comparably , a policeman will get a slap on the wrist for most of those things b very publicly ? when i get back to tucson i 'll start asking how many people heard about this c identification gives me , what , a name ? going through the legislative system is itself a problem which i 'd be willing to argue against if i did n't have to rehash it as many times as a biologist rehashes evolution to a creationist suffice to say that if a system is corrupt , trying to fix it through its own corrupt ways is not likely to work finally , it does n't take violence to harass policemen and let them know what they were doing was wrong could you imagine the effects of waves of hate mail washing up on your doorstep because of your job ? that 's good enough to get a lot of people looking elsewhere for employment , and probably more effective than looking to legislatures
5	yes holding every public official , and especially those elected , is the only way to run a proper government anything less and you 're descending into a fascist dictatorship inch by inch the more scrutiny public servants come under , the better job they will do
1	worship these guys all you want , but when new security laws come out in response to this crimespree do n't say i did n't tell you so what do you expect to be the result of this ego driven spree of leaks ? you really think we gain so much information about the world from a bunch of pedestrian documents from ' zona pd ? we 're not learning anything we did n't know before and it 's clear that lulzsec is n't in it for " activism " but for the e respect they get for ' taking on the man ' this is childish bullshit and i'm not surprised at how many of you are complete suckers for it
1	we are targeting azdps specifically because we are against sb1070 and the racial profiling anti immigrant police state that is arizona these guys are dumbasses the arizona department of public safety is not the border patrol or sheriff joe 's mcso they are basically highway patrol if they come across illegal immigrants , they do not arrest them or detain them border patrol or ice will do that they patrol highways , assist stranded motorists , investigate accidents , compile crime statistics for arizona and compile police studies ( like infiltrating nazi groups ) if lulzsec wanted to do something constructive , they could have targeted crooks like sheriff joe fuck them sb1070 is n't even being enforced by any state police or judges
2	no private home phone numbers are crossing a line police and even politicians have a right to a personal life as long as they have a way to be contacted and can be held accountable , they 're entitled to privacy in their personal lives it 's their public lives , such as actions while on patrol on statements made regarding a political issue , that need to be publicized furthermore , committing a crime or doing wrong by a law abiding citizen is something that they should be held accountable for and under no circumstances should their position get them preferential treatment whether or not they 're attempt to abuse power is worth of harsher treatment is arguable , but they definitely should not get off easy
7	but the cops dispatched to " track you " would of course just be doing their jobs , and they 'd be paid for it when the tables are turned is when they get upset
6	exactly , i'm saying the cops do not have anonymity either
7	hey man , mind giving us your phone number , home address , full name , email address , email password , spouse 's name ( if any ) , and email address ? oh and where you work as well ? all we want to do is freely distribute it to tons of people on bitorrent thanks , a person enjoying anonymity on the internet
1	way to be a fucking creep i make a joke about how fucked up the world is , and you turn into captain america learn what sarcasm is
6	funny how you ca n't even get my quote correct typical have a nice life here on reddit
5	but it 's not theirs to release thus , it is a ' leak ' of documents that were n't supposed to get out
6	i do n't know about net neutrality but it definitely gives ammunition to people who want to curtail eliminate the anonymity of the internet
2	if i remember correctly indiscriminate killing of civilians has lead to the loss of every major guerilla war in the modern age such examples would include , vietnam , the soviet invasion of afghanistan , the chinese civil war
1	sadly , you speak the truth lulzsec needs to get the fuck out i guess they released the email addresses and passwords to porn accounts for the benefit of watching porn , too , right ?
3	it just might be that some of the people in lulzsec just want to see the world burn
8	thank you i mean , it 's really no different than stringing up tax collectors who were just acting on the king 's orders back on the old days someone has to do those jobs as a current telemarketer i know people do n't like mine much
1	again , what a crock of shit your friends can only go to sleep at night because " i'm just doing my job " maybe when they 're in actual danger they 'll grow a fucking spine and stop supporting evil shit like this
2	net neutrality has been fucked for years now we 'll never get it stop clinging to that one small dream that will never happen
2	i'm all for lulzsec then congratulations you 're an idiot ! lulzsec is , at best , neutral they 've fucked over innocent people because they thought it was funny they do n't serve your agenda they do n't serve any agenda they act according to whatever whims they 've chosen for the moment , and they represent the internet and web culture incredibly poorly when the government starts really pushing for things like internet ids , this will be the sort of thing they point to so far the vast majority of their " hacks " have been technically unimpressive hack work like sql injection they 're nowhere near as good as they think they are , and if they piss off the wrong people the nsa will end them quickly and harshly
1	what a crock of shit you know why police officers do n't worry about the fact that they enforce brutal and disgusting laws ? because they 're afforded anonymity and unaccountability unlike the rest of the public if the people with a state approved strong arm feel like they 're in actual danger from the public , when they feel like their lives are on the fucking line , they 'll be like the rest of us so no , leak their addresses the moment they ca n't just repeat the mantra " i'm just doing my job " is the moment things change
4	thank you for injecting some common sense into the argument
6	lulzsec is going to war with the global elite they hacked the gaming community to get attention alright they need every eye in america watching this and it worked
6	obviously this is a new phenomenon ( http www networkworld com community node <> ) and it 's not like this has been going on since the advent of the internet ( http en wikipedia org wiki kevin mitnick ) no amount of regulation and no number of draconian laws will ever be able protect people from their own stupidity the government has been trying to noose the web for decades now and thanks to mass ignorance this time it might work
1	" for a community that touts itself on being intelligent , diverse , and accepting , i have seen few other organizations completely demonize an entire profession quite as swiftly and callously as reddit has done with police officers " because police officers can and do completely fuck up peoples lives , and you hear about it weekly they have so much power and there are examples of it being abused over and over again if police do n't want to be vilified , then it 's time they clean their own house if they did their job with good intentions , their emails , and memos , and inter agency communications would be mostly boring to the public and people would move on instead , there is a seed of corruption in most police forces in the united states , and the so called " good cops " seem unwilling to do anything about it you may have friends in law enforcement , but i grew up in a cop family , so i have seen and heard cops regularly bending or breaking the law most of my life
2	i will first say that i agree with you on the first point , i understand some people wanted to do the right thing , i even thought of being a cop myself however , in the end , i could never work as a policemen or as a bank teller because my job means contributing to a largely evil system i ca n't just choose to enforce the laws i want and ignore the bad ones , and since your friends ca n't do that either , they 're choosing to enforce evil laws , and that makes me rather ambivalent to their emotions on the issue as for the authority , i guess i grew to hate it over the course of a few years in high school i used to be a big randian capitalist however , after reading a lot of books about social democracy , which lead to books on democratic socialism , which lead to books on anarcho syndicalism , now i have very little sympathy for most people in the system you try to educate them on the evils of it and they turn a blind eye they 'd rather ignore suffering and blatant evil that they are involved in capitalism and the government are intertwined so thoroughly , that it would be accurate to say policemen essentially enforce the desires of the rich and powerful rich people own jails and cigarette and liquor companies after all so they can command the politicians to command the police to throw pot smokers into jail , rich people when , poor people lose and so long as police serve the rich , so long as they 're the knights of the god damn feudal lords , i do n't care how nice they are in person , their ultimate loyalty is to an enemy
4	dear internet hacking groups this is how you gain supporters
2	chaotic neutral is called the " anarchist " or " free spirit " alignment a character of this alignment is an individualist who follows his or her own heart , and generally shirks rules and traditions although they promote the ideals of freedom , it is their own freedom that comes first good and evil come second to their need to be free , and the only reliable thing about them is how totally unreliable they are chaotic neutral characters are free spirited and do not enjoy the unnecessary suffering of others , but if they join a team , it is because that team 's goals happen to coincide with their own at the moment they invariably resent taking orders and can be very selfish in their pursuit of personal goals a chaotic neutral character does not have to be an aimless wanderer they may have a specific goal in mind , but their methods of achieving that goal are often disorganized , unorthodox , or entirely unpredictable
8	depends if they have a hierarchical leadership if they are like anonymous then they are more like an idea rather than an actual group different individuals will take individual action which they are personally accountable for that 's also how anarchism works , there may be a collective objective however everyone is responsible for their own actions
2	while i agree with your contention here , i do have a problem with this line and regardless , these are people with families doing their jobs not some faceless government entity i do not know who else to reference other than lewis black " people act like government is a big building , with arms and legs , walking around doing shit " government is people those are people with wants and needs who succumb to base human emotions that are signing these things into law while the police should not be the target of this operation , maybe their involvement will get the ball rolling on fixing the problem they are already ignoring the citizenry , and even the police not enforcing the law does not change the fact that it is still highly enforceable
3	heh you can wear a mask but the feds can follow you or just track your phone without a warrant you can proxy up but their reach is global no one is truly anonymous and no one is safe
6	edit innawoods replaced his entire comment , which consisted of " everyone who is a fascist ftfy " my original reply remains below is that what it means to you to have a friend ? should the police be checking out your notebooks ?
1	sorry to prove godwin right ( once again ) but is n't this the whole " nazis were just following orders too " argument ? plus many of those officers were in support of sb1070 wikipedia arizona 's law enforcement groups have been split on the bill , <> <> with statewide rank and file police officer groups generally supporting it and police chief associations opposing it however , the phoenix law enforcement association , which represents the city 's police officers , has supported the legislation and lobbied aggressively for its passage i do n't condone the posting of personal information by anybody and definitely think lulzsec is just going after anybody and everybody but if sb1070 is the motivation , then that 's proper justification imo who better to punish than the group that would 've sheepishly til sheepishly is actually a word enforced , supported , and been used as a model in other states to pass the same laws
5	you know , you 're right about that i was thinking that they had to consult the public before they made a decision , but that 's not necessary for them to be held accountable fair enough although i still do n't think that releasing private information is the same as holding them accountable
4	thanks , this was really late at night , and when i woke up , i can only be appalled at my spelling seriously " rich people when , poor people lose "
6	how ?
2	if lulzsec was able to get their hands on that information , every , yes every other group , hackers or not , that sets their mind to it would have been able to get that information the news here is the major failure of protecting sensitive information , next to the outstanding stupidity of az ( us ) law enforcement policies and even greater stupidity of the enforcers
4	i love this , what 's even better are that these people are ready to teach everyone how to do this sort of thing
3	we should remember we live in a golden age for online activism one day these people will realise that a guerilla war is being fought they know how to fight against a guerilla war indiscriminate murder of civilians i will not be surprised if that is not how they respond to this ' hacking ' one day the hacking community will have its own my lai , luckily things have not reached that stage yet , before they realise we must expose them !
1	i may have had some 's ympathy ' for lulzsec at first but now fuck them i hope they get caught and are raped in the ass in prison lulzsec only did this because az had weak security not because of any righteous bullshit ' racial profiling ' bullshit that they are spewing in their press release
3	i 've said it before and i 'll say it again these people will cost us net neutrality
1	fuck this , fuck lulzsec , and fuck anyone who thinks this is cool or admirable or anything other than horribly invasive i have friends in law enforcement and banking who i honestly feel terrible for because they 're constantly vilified despite not doing anything beyond work hard at their low level jobs how the fuck anyone can cry foul about patriot act and government spying but think this is some novel endeavor is beyond me " first they came for the communists , " etc
6	i agree , not sure why someone down voted you
6	how the fuck is this a leak ? lulzsec intentionally released it they did n't " leak " it
3	i understand somebody who got high and is pissed a cop caught them and arrested them for breaking the law might want to abuse this information i 'd honestly rather see the cops not have access to your address without a subpoena or a court order of some sort than to have their address published as well sure , they may be a great guy and a decent cop , but sooner or later a criminal might decide to make it personal , and i 'd rather not have anyone or their family endangered in the name of full disclosure but i do agree that a single consistent standard should be upheld and applicable to all citizens , regardless of job or position
8	ok , being that you are unable to understand , here is my point there is corruption on a mass scale i do n't see where it is wrong to hope that corruption gets exposed , because once the corruption is outed , we can move on to improvement even though this group may be going about it all wrong , at least we can hope they expose some real scandal , and some actual justice and good comes out of the mess trenchcoat boy ? not hardly , jidf go back to your video games
2	thank you , people do n't understand the internet has been under attack sense <> <> , and i wo n't stop being censored until its stopped
6	what came first the chicken or the egg ? operation payback was a response to anon 's ' hacktivism ' , lulzsec is just an extension of this same type of online criminality you ca n't just say welp it was going to happen anyways , no these laws and cybersecurity firms were n't needed until people decided to engage in shady activity
6	they did it to get every ones attention and i 'd say it worked it 's like putting up a giant billboard or a bat signal depending on how things go )
8	because leaking the names and addresses of police officers isnt " activism "
6	what about redditors who used to be b tards and now get a pang of nostalgia at the sight of fresh lulz ?
8	because he just talked in favor of lulzsec r gaming is still pretty upset at their targeting of game companies , especially minecraft they are attention whoring and releasing personal information some think they are a plant to usher in new web censorship laws to get to my point , they should n't be releasing all this info to prove their point , there are better ways the above positive portrayal of lulzsec disagrees with some of the hivemind
6	possibly because they put multiple officers in danger by releasing their personal information ?
4	i'm guessing some people feel salty about how the information is obtained i do n't i'm all for lulzsec and organizations like wikileaks the people should know what the law enforcement is doing i think activists just got fed up with law enforcement hiding behind national security to cover up their questionable actions this is how groups like lulzsec is born
2	i did n't downvote but this " activism " crosses a line when personal addresses of police officers is released the police force did n't pass sb1070 and the bill is n't even being enforced lulzsec is punishing the wrong group here those officers and their families had nothing to do with sb1070 and the release of their personal information completely undermines lulzsec 's assumed high ground
4	finally glad to see them doing more than ddos ' ing and grabbing e mails from members of the gaming industry and are moving on to something practical
2	drug trafficking organizations ( dtos ) , are using available gps technology to target rivals dtos are placing gps tracking devices on load vehicles of their rivals to reveal stash house locations , in order conduct home invasions raids to steal drugs and money on a later date " gee , it 's too bad the courts have ruled that it is perfectly legal to put a tracking device on someone 's car , even without a warrant or other authority i guess that means if you want to prosecute these criminals , you 'll have to wait until they execute their home invasions
8	not every cop in arizona is an asshole racist and releasing detailed instructions on how they use informants to infiltrate some pretty nasty groups while providing names and addresses seems pretty reckless
2	did you miss the part about sb1070 not being enforced ( http en wikipedia org wiki arizona sb <> ) ? the day before the law was to take effect , a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that blocked the law 's most controversial provisions <> arizona has sought , unsuccessfully to date , to reverse that decision in the federal appeals courts did you also forget how the branches of the government work ? police enforce the laws that the legislature passes and the governor signs and regardless , these are people with families doing their jobs not some faceless government entity
1	that 's ironic seeing as you are the one that is enjoying anonymity if your life is on the " fucking line " i do n't think you should be making comments against the state approved strong arm they could very well track you !
1	what a crock of shit you know every arrest , every ticket , every traffic stop , every report is stamped with an officers name badge number ? every time an officer makes a stop and radios dispatch it is logged police have no anonymity they may not have as much accountability as we would like but there is accountability a police officers home address phone number password personal email is completely unrelated to topic at hand you want to make a statement about this retarded law ? release the logs showing officers racial profiling release the arrest records showing officers just arresting mexicans the police officers had nothing to do with passing this law
2	" if there 's nothing wrong going on , then there 's nothing to hide " except when you do need to hide things like state secrets
3	releasing cell phone numbers , private email addresses and home addresses is not transparency it is dangerous
8	i just do n't understand why you would say something like this at all police officers ' private information phone numbers , home addresses , spouses , spouses ' email addresses do not need to be publicly available on the internet for the public to hold them accountable you know how we hold people accountable in the united states of america ? laws elections these police officers do n't want their actions and intentions hidden ( well maybe they do , i do n't know , but that 's not at issue here ) , they want their private information hidden that 's not unreasonable and although i disagree with police actions from time to time , i for one think that these disagreements should be settled by courts and laws i also disagree with arizona 's laws but that should be settled again by more laws and elections also , do you really think holding " every action " accountable is a good way to run a government ? i mean , you think it 's inefficient now just imagine what it 'd be like if officials had to clear every action with the public there 's not enough red tape in the world
6	i do n't understand the problem someone has to have done the leaking , right ? the government did n't want the information getting out , but someone with access to it worked with lulzsec to leak it out and release it
2	edit for clarification the above poster is content with his daddy 's money , and his video games , and his mommy 's basement , so he does n't want anything to change inside his little bubble , because nothing affects him , therefore it is easy for him to pigeonhole me he either thinks everything in the world is bright and rosy , or likes it the way it is " nothing harder than trying to get someone to understand something , when their paycheck depends on them not understanding it "
6	so the global elite is zeus hiding fire ( read liberty ) from humanity and lulzsec is prometheus who steals it back for us but is ultimately banished for his slight against the gods ?
6	wow , what juevos , taking on the man in a frontal attack ! relevant repost ( http i imgur com hvvcf jpg )
6	i was under the impression that lulzsec was the anti anonymous this sounds like hacking for " good " as opposed to doing it just for the lulz am i wrong ?
6	why are n't they attacking the federal government since they put the illegal in illegal immigration
3	i'm not really against chinga la migra , but if these guys just put out raw data like this they 're going to get somebody killed you know the bad guys have computers too , yeah ? if there are informants names and identity there will be blood on the streets as long they understand this , but i doubt if they do
3	according to this totally legitimate ( http www youtube com watch ? v <> ) and awesome taiwanese animated news report , lulzsec and anonymous have joined forces for operation antisec which is aimed at governments
3	not really while there is a chance someone may die , it is a direct result of that person deciding to continue in their line of work supporting this the people who ' had no choice ' as they were too poor and had no other job options are not the people to be put in risk the guy going undercover in some gang , he could have taken a different job of course , as always , when someone is killed , the blame lies with the killer
3	as a former usps worker , i hope not that is the most fucked up company agency ever the unions are so strong that they are strangling the company dry of revenue you have people who intentionally walk slower so that they get more hours ( time and a half after <> hours , double pay after <> ) these people scream and yell at supervisors and get away with murder many of the clerks work super slowly one trick of the trade is to go to the doctor and have him put a lifting restriction on you that way , you do n't have to lift anything over that weight oh , and if a temporary employee makes more hours than a " regular " union employee , the union employee gets paid for the difference in time
8	we need photo id for a lot of important transactions we need it to vote even mexico requires photo id this will get over ridden , just like the budget first rethug leg in <> year in nc , they 're gonna do thing different she 's a decent gov , imo , but i think she is missing it here
4	awesome post ! that was my thesis
4	good for her those laws are racist bullshit
4	hahahaha funny funny
2	the important thing to remember here is that republicans and conservatives are masters at the political game they know what they 're doing is unpopular , but they manage to pass these inhumane , draconian , fiscally insane measures , then when election time rolls around , they jack up the batshit crazy propaganda machine , flood the airwaves with fear , hate , and lies , and minimize their losses everyone needs to take an active roll in recording what they are doing , then using that information in the election cycle to debunk their propaganda and demonstrate without a doubt the extremist corporate agenda they are ramming down america 's throat
6	about time that starts getting covered
6	because it 's only the conservative justices doing this , right ?
5	sadly accurate
8	he is a great candidate , and could actually be fairly good on either side of the d r aisle he is intelligent , has reasonable policies , good speaking skills , understands national and international reality however , he does n't currently have the required level of insanity ( either religious , warmonger or economic ) that all of the current republican candidates seem to need at the moment this will be his biggest barrier to acceptance in the conservative camp
6	since lincoln ? a reach for sure , but an interesting read
3	no , the drug war is the natural result of prohibition exactly the same happened during alcohol prohibition , except that policy got cancelled before it got too far out of hand

6	how often are we going to see that mix for scotus votes ?
2	obama has said a lot of things , and has unduly flaked on just about as things
8	the " same rights " would include marriage , and obama has never supported that it seems as if he is trying hard to appease both sides of the issue civil union is progress , though
1	and hell remove his statement in the following days just like he did on palestine its a shame really that even the president cant say what he wants to
1	semantics with regard to politics is really starting to piss me off i do n't believe the government should be able to dictate whether or not homosexuals can be " married " leave that to the church that is their institution if the end goal is civil unions , then we should stop even using the words " gay marriage " same with climate change when you refer to it as " global warming " it lets the herp derps be all like " lol , if there was such a thing as global warming then why is it getting colder in the winter ? " " climate change " at least implies " man the weather has been more fucked up than i can remember in my lifetime "
1	vote for ron paul , he would n't fight gays getting married
2	telling gay people they can get a " civil union " but not a " marriage " is logically and morally equivalent to " separate but equal " i wish i knew whether obama was playing politics here , or if he actually believed this the former would show moral cowardice , the latter moral dereliction
8	i completely agree
1	he would , however , support the " right " of states to ban gay sex liberty ! ! <> ! !
6	which terrorist ?
6	if the tsa finds it is appropriate that adults need to subjugate themselves to overly invasive procedures because of some ' terrible evil ' , but not kids , does the ' terrorist ' really give a shit if its a kid or an adult ?
2	well there 's your problem timmy geithner is a moron
1	fuck you asshole let the government shrink its nothing but a massive murderous parasite
2	obama has kept his promise on afghanistan to the letter he said he was going to escalate it he did now he has started the withdrawal process regardless of whether you agree that is the right thing , the title of your post is a total and complete lie

2	that was n't clear at all that did n't make any god damn sense to be quite honest that was the exact opposite of clear
1	republicans know how to sell an idea and they have the backing of a large amount of money to help push the ideas it 's not easy for anyone in public office to vote against things the people think they need want the " death tax " is a classic example renaming the estate tax to that was genus many folks do n't understand that that means the kids of rich folks now get up to <> million tax free for doing zero work
1	what ? ! you mean funneling increasing amounts of society 's wealth to plug the financial holes in bureaucratic waste is not helpful to the economy ? ! clearly you are a traitor to all americans ! ! !
4	haha i get it )
3	it depends on where the taxes are coming from over the past <> years we have had the idea of trickle down economics taxes have shifted from the high earners to the middle to low earners http www washingtonpost com wp srv special business income inequality so now we have a situation where the top <> hold <> of all the wealth in the us money power that is a huge amount of power in very few hands our tax system use to keep the system is better balance it no longer does
2	we all work our whole lives in the hopes of giving our children a better future having the govt just take a ton of already taxed money that you set aside for your kids , just because they can , is theft
2	repetition does n't make truth
2	so with that logic someone can get <> billion or more tax free for doing zero work how can one have a country where if someone works for the money they have to pay taxes but if someone does zero work to get the money they pay zero taxes that is not a good system trust fund kids should pay taxes on money they did not earn
6	yeah the republicans have had all the power the past couple of years or is it that the democrats are so stupid that they are easy prey for the vastly superior republicans ?
2	do n't editorialize in your headlines please
1	no , let me be clear fuck you for acting like cutting off funding to the most violent organization on the planet makes you a traitor get your head out of your ass that 's all i should say you think government spending is the way out of poverty ? tell that to north koreans , where they eat grass to survive why do n't you try to really picture what that 's like you 're starving , you want a nice big hamburger , you have n't eaten in three whole days , but what is there to eat ? grass cold , unfilling grass you do n't have clean water , either the government run meth lab that 's producing all the meth for china nearby has filled it with solvents that sting your eyes and your throat if you try to drink it , and make you sick so your throat is so parched that the dry grass is cutting your throat and no matter how much of it you eat you ca n't fill your stomach you 're lucky if you can get out of that country without tripping a landmine or getting killed by an electric fence that is , if the guards do n't see you if the government the group in a society that claims it ' s the only group allowed to use force has forbidden you to raise cattle , forbidden you to grow your own food , forbidden you to read books then what will you do to survive ? that 's all a government can do it can either forbid things , or it can take money from you by force and pour it into something else and when it does the second thing , you know what happens ? the people in charge of distributing the money take it for themselves , because there is nothing to stop them the people at the top are criminals , they 're not going to fire them or punish them the whole thing is a giant criminal organization and here you are preaching about how we need to give more money to one yes , it 's just as bad here , it 's actually worse our population is <> million , that 's <> <> of the whole world 's population , and we have one half of the world 's military spending all that money goes to kill people with big , fancy humvees and tanks and rocket launchers and helicopters government spending in north korea is something like <> <> of gdp government spending in the u s is <> of gdp but of course , we 're much richer than they are reddit , do n't upvote this guy <> days ago he posted a headline saying this laugh it up you are all going to die from lung or stomach cancer from nuclear ' fleas ' emanating from japan and raining on the entire northern hemisphere , undetectable by geiger counter nuclear fleas ? really ? but the rest of his post history is a months long temper tantrum against the " gop " i'm thinking " propaganda account , " if not just " gullible idiot " no offense , " truthandjustice , " but you need some serious perspective , either way i see you have all these posts about jesus , you seem to buy into christianity so let me clear something up for you http reddit com r iama comments gh3fd i am a working pastor and have basically lost my read your bible the government killed jesus pontius pilate was a roman governor jesus taught his disciples that pontius pilate was corrupt , that his relationship with the elders of judea was corrupt , that the whole business of politics and money changing and usury was corrupt and guess what ? that 's still the defining feature of our government , gop and democrat alike our politicians borrow money and then make us pay it back , plus interest

2	nothing personal to ted , but his generation is the one in charge right now and they are largely the reason this country has so many problems
6	as a member of the millennial generation i have to ask who the hell is ted nugent ?
2	ted is a draft dodging chicken hawk , and should keep quiet about any subject concerning americans and the military out of sheer embarrassment over his former actions
6	how does bitching about how many wars we 've been in and how much money we spend on the military contradict dodging the draft ?
1	ted 's a cunt fuck ted
6	ask ted the patriot why he dodged the draft during vietnam , then get back to me , flag waver
8	you are the epitome of ted 's narrative ted 's right , yet feeble minded people like you can not comprehend that patriotism , valor , and the right of americans to govern themselves apart from a large and corrupt government free from the " wisdom " of power hungry politicians are things to strive for , not to bemoan
8	i am also a veteran and ssg in the us army if you have ever served , you know how much he has done for the troops and the uso
8	ted is a representative of a portion of his generation , i e the flag waving super patriots who proved to be chicken hawks when the chips were down as such he does n't deserve the sweat off the b lls of a real american patriot at least that 's the opinion of a veteran and member of the silent generation
2	has less to do with current , and more to do with the stupid james thurber readings

1	that bastard barack obama went back and edited your post to make it look like i was just repeating you when i asked you what it 's like living in a near delusional state of paranoia ! that fucker ! you 'd think he 'd have more pressing things to attend to , but i guess he 's just that petty
2	that 's correct , please what it is like ? are you easily manipulated into believing and doing anything the government tells you to do ? or is it simply something you struggle with day to day ? for example , if dick cheney told you who was behind <> <> , would you believe him , simply because you are so hysterical you will believe anything to make your weak mind secure again ? obama 's silence on local and state police brutality is in violation of the general welfare clause the federal government must promote the general welfare silence is in direct opposition to that clause and cause for immediate impeachment his silence is to gain more police votes that , though , is against our democratic principles
2	you 're really bad at this " convincing people " thing
6	i found your headline to be sensationalized and it contained ad hominem the article didnt include much substance i'm not trying to judge your political ideology or personal beliefs , they are yours to hold i thought thought it would only be right to follow the reddiquette and explain my down vote

1	says the delusional troll with a <> minute old reddit account you do n't even have the balls to to speak your bullshit with your real account you are such a coward
6	um wtf ?
1	the federal government must promote the general welfare by remaining silent on this issue , and by remaining silent on the issue of local and state police brutality , they are not following the general welfare clause that is cause for impeachment
6	oh , i forgot , the executive branch has divorced itself from being responsible for the authorities that ' execute ' or ' carry out ' the laws my mistake my mistake carry on , kneel to your king and kiss his cloth anybody know what its like living in a near delusional state of paranoia ? you there borfo did you hear my question ?
3	what did obama actually have to do with this ? serious question
6	what 's it like living in a near delusional state of paranoia ?
1	i do n't really care what you 're advocating here the fact is that you 're bloody awful at it if you want people to listen to you , stop screaming at them like some sort of juvenile lunatic and start making rational arguments cite your sources leave ad hominem attacks at the door , because insults only alienate the people you wish to convince get a grip

6	wait , is n't that backwards ? if austin is truly a majority liberal , then dividing it up with the minority conservative areas dilutes the conservative votes , thus making it more likely for liberals to be elected in each of those separate districts

6	wow , this needs more attention you should submit some proof in a new link you 'll probably get some karma headed your way
8	well if those are the only cases where he wants the federal government to be involved , it would be rather small i agree though most republican politicians do n't want smaller government they just want to move the attention somewhere else
6	yeah , republicans just want smaller government when it comes to business and economics if they wanted smaller government in social issues too , they 'd be libertarians
2	they want less gov regulation for their particular issues and more for the opposition 's , just like the opposition does obvious tactic is obvious
2	both parties want to apply the same amount of presents of government , just in different places
4	republicans do n't actually want smaller government i'm a republican and i want smaller government i want the states and not the feds to make decisions on marriage , abortion , and substance legalization
7	actually this is not completely accurate the republicans we have now have been thoroughly infiltrated by the neo conservative movement which is far from conservative their policies have tended to dominate since the bush administration they were considered nuts prior to that and had little power there are true conservatives that want to reduce government but , they are out numbered by these whack jobs neo con should actually have been called pseudo con ( or false fake ) so , i do agree with you that your statement is accurate for all of the neo cons there are however , some republicans still that want reduced government they just have trouble being heard so , while you are accurate it was not <> accurate because , it was not true of all republicans , just the current majority
2	ironically , weed was made illegal because of the same lies more than <> years ago plus it " makes darkies think there as good as white men "
8	i believe in the freedom for private businesses to allow what they wish in their bars others believe in the freedom of people to go into any bar without the smell of smoke freedom is different to different people trying to fit everyone into one box is tyrannical
6	i agree with this due process under the law is absolutely essential in a free and open society ( that was tough to type ) due process is how , through the <> amendment , the states became restricted by the bill of rights it is state actions would be legal under the libertarian system this is what happens when democrats re legitimize rank and file gop i have no idea what that means it is what happens when the gop ( http www guardian co uk world <> jun <> america pregnant women murder charges ) controls the state government and it is what ron paul would be happy with since it is states doing this rather than the federal government
6	it 's tiring and thankless work , but someone 's gotta do it
5	the only thing making me weep here is your sorry comment a lot of the barriers to entry today exist because subsidies and tax credits give unfair advantage to private corporations for creating their own monopolies or duopolies case in point communication companies ( att , comcast , etc )
4	i was aware of that actually , but connecticut did n't elect him governor , you see )
6	maybe the cartels are actually paying this guy off just a thought
5	yeah but it would end up the same way drug cartels do n't sell cigarettes , because you can buy cigarettes at the gas station drug cartels do n't sell alcohol , because you can buy alcohol at the liquor store drug cartels sell weed , but they only sell weed because there is a high demand and there is no other supply when you can buy weed at headshops ( i assume headshops will be the liquor stores of weed ) , then there will be enough ( legal ) supply of weed that the cartel wo n't have anyone to sell to the mafia may be a joke compared to cartels , but it works the same way
2	yeah a pit boss could comp you a meal without having to check the goddamn balance on your rewards card
3	yeah apparently it was stupid cheap because the mob did n't even care about making money on the businesses your average tourist was going to partake in they were making illegal money elsewhere i 've heard it was pretty awesome back when the hotels and casinos did n't actually need to support themselves
4	i did n't post it , but i did send the link to him when i emailed him on his site )
3	the unnecessary comma kind of ruins it
1	fuck limited government i do n't want corporations controlling everything
2	hey man , the cartels do n't have shit on our dinner selections
1	i wish i could have a civilized , non politicized debate with one of these anti marijuana politicians just one time just once and not have my concerns waved off it seems they are just turning a blind eye to reason now i mean , this guy is fucking voted in to congress right ?
6	wo n't let me send him an email because i live in another district i suppose i could find a zip code in his district but i think you guys will probably take care of it
6	the most chill place on the planet ? have you even been to reddit ?
6	i am wondering how close this guy is to the alcohol lobbies ? i do not know if it 's true , but i was told the alcohol companies and their lobbies are the primary funders behind the anti marijuana efforts
8	good intentions , but terrible plan as a us citizen , you have one congressman assigned to you they represent you ( theoretically ) and no one else in any other district whatever you say write will be passed along to your local rep if you do not give your home address , it 'll be thrown out
1	we got the right to beararms let 's maul the fuck out of him
2	this guy is the congressman for my district in san antonio i sent him an email yesterday morning about the bill being introduced asking him to consider it as a means to promote social health no response yet he is pretty socially conservative with deep connections with homeland security the man is not the person i want representing me and knowing what side of town i'm on makes me curious as to how a white man got support from a lot of lower middle class african and mexican americans end rant
2	since mj is not legal at the state level this really does n't matter much if states would grow some balls and legalize getting the feds to go alone would be easy until states legalize there is no point in even considering any federal legislation also do n't expect this to stop companies from drug testing you
1	the fda has not authorized smoked tobacco for any condition or disease i do n't see them authorizing the use of alcohol both are classified as drugs , both are legal and taxed , and both kill hundreds of thousands of americans every year fuck you , lamar fuck you up your fucking clenched asshole
6	i hope lulzsec gets him
8	for what it 's worth , this is the exact letter i ( an austin resident ) just sent to mr smith ming boggling as the son of a former police chief with over <> years of law enforcement experience , i am writing to tell you that i am considerably disappointed by your decision in blocking the recent marijuana legalization bill submitted by paul and frank i have never smoked marijuana and know the damages its use cause mainly social and economic damages caused by sustained , unmerited criminalization i know you have no intention of personally reading this message and much less intention of in any way considering it this assumption is based on your actions towards this bill that clearly speak to pre existing biases , not fact that said , it is my civic duty to inform you that i and many well informed individuals around me completely and categorically disagree with your willingness to continue the economic damages caused by prohibition at home ( prison costs , lost tax revenue , law enforcement funding for " war on drugs " , the list continues ) and the damages caused to so many families along and outside of our border because of the financial gain we 've given to life long criminals abroad i look forward to the day when you and your type are long gone and logic , reason , and those appalled with the misguided decisions of the past re enter our government good day sir
1	yeah fuck this guy with a pineapple
6	wonder if he has anything to do with the private prison system ? seems to me a big chunck of their revenue comes from " criminals " who are locked up because of marijuana if marijuana were legalized , wouldnt the private prison system take a huge hit ? see the other thread http thinkprogress org justice <> <> <> <> cca geogroup prison industry
5	i am not a member of representative your district , however i and many thousands of internet users have collectively decried your senseless killing of the bill hr2306 it is quite apparent that your position is based on the tautology that marijuana is bad because it 's bad the only reasons you cite are all either false or only true because the government actively quashes any domestic research that would lead to the obvious answer that marijuana is far less of a domestic health concern than alcohol , and in fact has several valid medicinal uses , as well as being the most harmless recreational substance consumed by human beings far less harmful to one 's health than alcohol , tobacco or even caffeine your statement that marijuana leads to other drugs is one of the biggest fallacies spread by politicians in an attempt to scare parents the causation and correlation here is beyond gummed up currently yes marijuana leads to other drugs this is not due to the substance itself but due to the underground black market culture to which the government has relegated it 's sale and cultivation marijuana does not lead to other drugs , spending too much time dealing with criminals does legalizing marijuana would solve that problem pretty fast i further question the logic of why , in these economic times , a republican would oppose the creation of a multibillion dollar industry which could lead to an immense revenue stream for the federal government legalization would literally bring the mexican drug cartels to their knees it is quite obvious that supporters of the war on drugs do not have the public 's best interest at heart as it only perpetuates crime and costs the american taxpayers billions of wasted dollars your conduct reveals an utter desire to remain in your seat instead of a willingness to do what 's right and practical
2	hate to ask , but does anyone have a good template of a message to send to this email ? i can write something up , but i have a lot on my plate right now and usually when i write these things , it takes me a while to revise and re revise it until i get it right i just do n't have the time right now , but still wanna send a message tia edit fuck it , i'm working on a draft right now
6	woodrow wilson administration we can go back a long ways and find the roots of our current crisis it was like a seed that has grown over time and we are now reaping what has been sewn over many administrations
6	ummm did you mean to talk to me ? this does n't seem at all relevant to the post i responded to and how i responded i actually agree with everything you just said it does n't have anything to do with my post that you responded to , or the person i responded to so , i'm a bit confused
1	you 're confusing moral conservatism with federal conservatism i'm an anti federalist , or a federal conservative i do n't give a flying fuck if you smoke weed , bang dudes chicks , have an abortion , or worship a fossilized turd i just do n't want the federal government involved in any of that shit conservative republican

3	our best action to stop this would be to start a twitter trend against him what are your suggestions for the hash tag ? i'm tired of living in fear of drug cartels , we need to take away their livelihood and return safety to south texas and the rest of the world so affected if this man was in tune with reality he of all people should know something must be done as he is a member of a community very ill affected by the drug war being from south texas himself
6	why are n't major media outlets picking this up ?
3	here is what i wrote i noticed in an interview that you said , " we ought to be enforcing our drug laws , not backing away from them " since richard nixon declared a war on drugs in <> , we have had hundreds of thousands of lives disrupted , and countless billions of dollars wasted you want to continue this ? do you expect a different result ? the only thing these policies have gotten us in the last <> years in the largest prison population on the face of the earth , entire communities torn apart ( not by cannabis , but backwards mandatory drug sentencing ) , and the cartels that provide the drugs have become more powerful than they have ever been drugs are more available than they have ever been this is the policy you want to continue ? i believe in results it seems that your political opinions are based more on your personal feelings than what actually works in the real world this makes your policies not only a waste of time , but actually detrimental to fixing this country the people are waking up to this charade the majority of americans are in favor of correcting this costly mistake your ideas belong in the scrapheap on humanity stop destroying people 's lives and this country with misguided policies that seem to have no basis in reality legislation is only effective when it achieves its desired result is it your hope that by continuing this policy we can cripple another generation , or is this just to ensure we have enough inmates for the rapidly growing private prison industry ? it is these policies and ideas that have caused many states to spend more on housing their prisoners than educating their children this is the america your ideas are creating do n't you think it is time we change direction with this misguided policy ?

2	well , no , not really you 'll note that the dedicated defenders of " state 's rights " are <> against states legalizing medical marijuana which brings me back to my point people who yammer about " state 's rights " are n't in favor of individual rights and they 're really just dogwhistling about fucking over minorities people fighting for medical marijuana try , sometimes , to use " state 's rights " as a loophole , but it does n't work for them , and they are n't really dedicated to " state 's rights " , they 're dedicated to individual rights and they 're taking whatever approach to getting those rights they think will work look at history slavery ended by federal mandate , enforced by federal guns who supported ending slavery ? it was n't the people yammering about " state 's rights " jim crow ended by federal mandate , enforced by federal guns who supported ending jim crow ? it was n't the people yammering about " state 's rights " no one serious about freedom is serious about " state 's rights " that 's because serious believers in freedom recognize the utter stupidity of that phrase states do n't have rights , people do in the fight for individual freedom i 'll use whatever weapon i can , and if the idiocy of " state 's rights " can be used to advance individual freedom i 'll use it but it ca n't all the " state 's rights " freaks stabbed you in the back on marijuana , because they hate freedom they do n't care about rights , they care about fucking over minorities

1	sent mr lamar it has come to my attention that you have stated you will prevent the passage of hr <> the frank paul bill which would deregulate marijuana at the federal level and leave it to the states to decide their laws first and foremost , the information you provided in defense of your actions are blatant lies marijuana does , in fact , have an accepted medical use thc has been used to treat victims of cancer for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting , appetite disorders , migraines , arthritis , glaucoma , depression , anxiety , and a myriad of ailments since you are a congressman , i will assume you had to of been smart enough to get to where you are today as this information is readily available online , i can only deduce that you have simply disregarded it you have gone on to say " decriminalizing marijuana will only lead to millions more americans becoming addicted to drugs and greater profits for drug cartels who fund violence along the u s " whether you honestly believe marijuana is a gateway drug , the fact of the matter is that it can be found anywhere in the united states there are no less people smoking it now than there were before prohibition began the only thing its illegality has done is pack innocent people into an already overcrowded prison system for victimless crimes however , there are still victims not of marijuana 's use but of its illicitness the people of mexico and americans living along the border who have suffered the violence of drug cartels once again , you have misstated the true outcome of ending the war on drugs if marijuana were allowed to grow on u s soil , it could be taxed and regulated , with its profits kept out of the hands of corrupt gangsters thus bleeding them dry of resources and reducing the heinous amount of crime currently running rampant once again , you should be fully aware of this , and the fact that you have presented your argument in this manner leads me to believe that you do not care about the truth lastly , it is absurd to think that alcohol and tobacco products which kill millions of people every year are legal in this country , and yet marijuana is not you know damn well that it is a harmless drug if you do not help put an end to this foolish federal policy , the blood of the victims of cartel violence will remain on your hands , you will continue to be perceived as a subordinate to the pharmaceutical , and for profit prison industries , and your name will forever be likened to hypocrisy please , end prohibition now

8	state 's rights is always in the context of opposing emancipation of slaves , civil rights , de segregation , gay rights , women 's rights , and church state separation i honestly have n't the slightest idea how you can make the statement you did with even a minimal knowledge of history or politics dhs and tsa was born ( patriot act ) state governments are n't exactly clamoring to oppose these things i think texas attempted to sort of limit the tsa 's use of pat downs the other <> have been completely mum so it 's not exactly a strong argument for " states rights " it was at that point in our history the federal government proved it was no longer concerned with protecting the rights of citizens well if you assume history started in <> , yes but with historical perspective , we 'd note the federal government was a lot more abusive in the mccarthy era the fbi had a lot more unchecked power in its early years under hoover than it does today nixon was a notable abuser of the agency to spy on political enemies which is neither a defense of the patriot act nor those historical things i'm only pointing out this does n't mark some turning point in our history the federal government is not now nor has it ever been a paragon of virtue it 's got a long history of disregard for individual rights but the states are n't now nor have they ever really fought the federal government to defend individual rights quite the contrary , it 's almost always been the reverse the federal government tends to be ahead of the vast majority of states in acknowledging and addressing the righteous grievances of individuals and minority groups which is why racists , etc always fall back to " states rights " as an argument , and why states rights is so strongly associated with institutional racism and bigotry rather than individual liberty
2	yeah , that 's not what people who yammer about " state 's rights " mean though they 've got some crazy idea that postal districts have rights and people do n't talk about " powers " if you must , but do n't confuse rights ( which are held by real people ) with powers that states may or may not have for me ? i'm a nationalist and i favor amending the constitution to strip the states of any pretensions of sovereignty and abolishing the senate in its current form states as anything but postal districts are an anachronism
8	i see you have been working hard
6	we can control the corporations power simply by controlling where we spend our money barrier to entry learn it weep
2	do n't try to figure it out this subreddit never makes any sense when it comes to upvotes downvotes
3	hemp oil can run a combustion engine ( cleanly ) , but i was mostly thinking about plastics , rope twine , and basically anything that is petroleum based today
2	i cannot disagree more strongly the very idea that freedom , liberty , should be determined on a state by state basis is repugnant either freedom is universal , or it is n't freedom
2	yup that 's basically it look at ronald reagan and his embrace of " state 's rights " during the campaign against carter he spoke about " state 's rights " at various civil war memorials and it was understood by racists that he meant he would fight to keep the federal government from stopping their racism his numbers in the south went up greatly following his dogwhistles to racists these days the dogwhistles are aimed as much at homophobes as they are at racists , but still outside hardcore rand worshiping libertarian circles talk of " state 's rights " is basically codespeak for " i will let you rednecks fuck up any minority you hate " more to the point , the whole idea is just plain stupid people have rights legal fictions do not you 'd think that 'd be something libertarians would get , but apparently not and , frankly , i'm not at all sure that even in hardcore rand worshiping libertarian circles the dogwhistle aspect is n't part of the appeal ron paul certainly had and has no trouble courting the explicitly racist voter
2	in my state yes no federal agent has raided a dispensary or grow operation acting within colorado 's constitutional law while i agree that cannabis should be completely legal , the only places busted in colorado are those that are not acting within the laws colorado 's constitution provides
2	" do n't like federal hegemony ? well , you 're obviously a racist dog whistles " really classy
2	i agree with you somewhat , but i 'd rather have certain issues decided at the state level then the federal level it 's much easier to move to another state than to move to another country state powers have been used for good as well such as the fugitive slave act ( http en wikipedia org wiki fugitive slave act of <> )
2	this is my problem with ron paul and other strict state 's rights advocates if we decide that something should be legal like gay marriage or weed , why leave it up to the states to decide it , whats going to happen is you are going to have the ignorant ( more religious ) states making it illegal and punishable by death ( joke ) , while the more progressive states allow it its just creating huge inequalities in between the states , and say if a state bans abortions outright , are they allowed to prosecute people who leave the state to have an abortion in a state where it is legal ( similar things for other issues ) i just think that if we are going to say something is legal and we want to try to debunk and fix the ignorance around those issues as well , than what good is it to still allow some states to remain in the dark with their ignorant opinions about it so they can ignore the facts ? it seems like a step backwards to me
2	yeah i prefer my individual rights be protected by the federal government over being infringed by the state states governments of any form do n't have rights and they certainly do n't have the right to infringe on the natural rights of individuals tyranny at the hands of a state is not ok just because it is a state
4	i support states ' rights and the legalization of gay marriage and marijuana , and many other things i also think that decentralized government gives the people the most power to fight for what they want and believe in , which is what liberty is about that includes allowing some areas to ban marijuana if people consent to it large government is a tool for corporations
2	i hear you but the problem with that is per the constitution , the real one , the one you need , any rights not specifically delineated to the federal government are reserved by the states true liberty is not derived from being a member of some protected group all citizens deserve the same protections , regardless of whatever ethnic or other subgroup they happen to be in that 's real liberty , not liberty defined by demographic
6	unbelievable what is this i do n't even this guy needs to be shut the fuck down
1	i fucking hate slippery slope arguments
2	" republicans are only for states rights when it suits them " , yes texas recently wanted to curtail the excesses of tsa searches , but the federal government would n't let them so all of this guy 's constituents need to be made aware he thinks everybody has to do whatever the federal government tells them to do
1	legalizing alcohol really made al capone and pals more powerful then ever ! not a day goes by that there is n't a gangland style shooting over selling moonshine !
6	i'm pretty sure almost every one of the points he brought up i 've seen disproved by reddit in the past few weeks
1	we need something like " scientific method " do be introduced to congress as in , if you spout bullshit , you have to prove your bullshit
1	fuck the fda they approve all kinds of pharmaceutics that allow doctors to push on children , but they wo n't even do studies on marijuana for adult cancer patients they are not looking out for the interest of people , they only look out for corporate interests
6	decriminalizing marijuana will only lead to greater profits for drug cartels this seems totally counter intuitive to me
1	thanks for the zipcode , i was looking for it so i could send an email i sent this " hello , just writing this to let you know how out of touch you are with what this country wants and needs voting under party lines and not with your heart is an abomination of what our forefathers founded this country on shutting down ron pauls attempt at rational thinking in the government is disappointing but hardly unexpected that fact that you really think marijuana has no medical uses shows that you have no use in a government position tell that to all the cancer patients that find ease in their procedures and radiation through the use of marijuana the fda has n't mandated any medical uses because the fda is tied to governmental funding funding that would not supply money for medical marijuana studies luckily , our friends across the ocean and other non profit organizations here have been doing plenty of tests instead of blindly dismissing something you are frightened by and know nothing about http medicalmarijuana procon org view resource php ? resourceid <> here is my source i am not writing this to bash you , your policies or your opinions , i am writing this to hopefully get you to open your eyes to a topic you obviously have n't even given a second look at whether it be for personal or political reason alcohol and tobacco kill hundreds of thousands of people a year and yet marijuana has exactly zero deaths attributed solely for its use so why exactly do you oppose it again ? oh yeah , because " people might get addicted ! " alert the presses , people can get addicted to anything there are plenty of people with damning addictions to video games and cheeseburgers should we go ahead and ban those things too ? open your eyes , sir , this country is changing for the better , but opinions and actions taken by people such as yourself , is what will hold back this country and keep the rest of the world laughing at us sincerely , a concerned american "
1	lamar smith you are an embarrassment to the republican party for not standing up for states ' rights and derailing ron paul 's bill to make marijuana a state issue stop being a neo conservative and stand up for our nation like our founding fathers who were willing to die for our freedom your callous actions destroy the liberty of thousands of lives every day
2	what an idiot legalizing marijuana would put those drug cartels out of business , not make them stronger why is this so hard to understand ?
4	this should be upvoted to the top , it made my emailing so much easier
6	i know we are filling up his voicemail and email , but are we having any real impact ? it seems like nothing will change his mind , and we 're just being annoying
2	i learned today that you played a role in blocking recent legislation brought by ron paul and barney frank that would be a step toward legalizing marijuana at the federal level as a texan , i am extremely disappointed in your action on this matter i am fully convinced that the " war on drugs " is a complete failure and new approaches need to be taken to treat those affected by drugs and its prohibition with wisdom , pragmatism and empathy i am no pro drug radical i am opposed to using marijuana personally and in my family i personally used it in my past during a low point in my life when i was young and it is something i am glad to have grown past and left behind the fact that it was illegal did not prevent my past use what prohibition did do was put my future at risk , and by the grace of god i was able to evade the worst prohibition has to offer , get cleaned up and become successful all the excessive criminalization of drug use in our country does is further marginalize and imprison the already poor and disadvantaged in our country decriminalization does not mean endorsement of drug use perhaps this is what needs to be made clear to the more reactionary constituents in our fair state decriminalization allows government control and tax over drug use , create economic incentives against it , and most importantly , take apart the organized criminal culture that has grown and adapted to its prohibition ok , i 'll admit it , i am outside your district , and i found a zip <> to get through your web form i feel bad about lying to your website , but i still think you should hear my opinion your actions still represent me nationally as a texan , and this is a matter i feel strongly about besides , the way we love to redistrict here in texas , you never know who you 'll get next !
6	all of them ? wow he has one for each of his branches the dc one was full last night , but the rest had room
2	you do know that your email will just get discarded or forwarded to your rep if you do n't live in his district , right ? all you 're doing is creating busy work for his interns
5	filling his mailbox is all well and good , but money talks and bullshit walks if you all really want to send a message that we wo n't tolerate these shenanigans donate to his opponent and make sure every one ( opponent , him and media ) knows where the surge of " green " is coming from and for why we have a big community here and if everyone can gush about pouring money into steam why do n't we also use reddit as a political tool <> each quit talkin ' and let 'em know

3	being close to the border , this guy is probably in the pocket of the cartels himself not only would legalization cut down on illegal profit , federal enforcement could concentrate more on smuggling and border patrol
1	wow , i wrote this guy an email yesterday morning urging him to consider the bill and he pulls this shit ? what a fucking tool i 'll make sure that my email this time around is much more unpleasant
1	i decided to email this guy , although i'm not a drug user , i believe in doing what i feel is right hopefully my email was n't too i dunno ignorant what do you think ? i would like to start out by stating that i spent five years active duty army , as an airborne infantryman stationed at fort bragg , nc i have two combat tours to iraq i have never been in serious trouble with the law , and do not use drugs i joined the army to fight for those who could n't or would n't do it for themselves i joined to make a difference , and that is why i'm emailing your office today the issue i am writing about is the possible " shut down " of hr <> , as supported by congressmen frank barney and ron paul i think this legislation is a step in the right direction and would have positive impacts across the board i can see no logical reason for marijuana being outlawed the only arguments being brought up are about the " gateway " effect and possible increased violence i disagree completely on both counts marijuana is no more a gateway drug to addiction than wine coolers are a gateway drink to alcoholism people will decide for themselves if they imbibe , and to what levels having a wine cooler while relaxing does not give you an urge to seek out harder alcohol nor does it make you an alcoholic this " gateway " effect has never been proven in any scientific study i think it 's foolish , and quite ignorant to use this as the primary point of contention using the current violence caused by drug cartels in mexico as your secondary point of contention ( and your " ace in the hole " ) is very disingenuous this violence is due to the amount of violence being put forth by dea and narcotics agents it 's all reactionary if there were no programs out to stamp out the growth and sale of marijuana , there would be no need for the growers to " protect " themselves with arms having a legitimate business in the eyes of the law makes felonious characters behave in accordance with the laws so they can be protected like " normal " people overall , it 's just good business to legalize it , regulate it , and tax the ever living life out of it think of all the money that 's been thrown into this war on drugs think of all the people imprisoned for marijuana distribution and possession think of the bottom line on this issue money it 's all about money since it 's illegal , dealers and growers can charge whatever they want for it they make their own rules and rule the game with an iron fist and an itchy trigger finger i 've seen this type of thing in iraq the local citizens formed their own neighborhood security groups they would not ask questions , or act humanely to people in their neighborhoods doing anything remotely suspicious they acted with extreme prejudice and violence once we , the united states army , legitimized these neighborhood security groups , we gave them rules we told them not to murder people , but rather to detain them and bring them to the police for questioning violence dropped significantly , and people were less afraid to leave their homes increased security for the citizens , and less violence from the security groups is a small win we furthered the legitimacy of these groups by offering them positions on the police force ( with approval from the iraqi police commander ) after a period of time in the security group this helped to establish pride in their neighborhoods , and really gave the younger men something to look forward to they trusted us to help them in the beginning , but by the time my <> months were over , they trusted their police force as much as us the police force was manned by their friends , family and fellow citizens in order to quell the violence , you have to give legitimacy to the problem , and recognize it for what it is a business legalize their product and you 've eliminated half the problem as far as the negative effects of marijuana ( health related ) i was unable to find any evidence of longterm problems there 's a plethora of information regarding the dangers of alcohol and tobacco , but not really anything that shows marijuana to be a danger if marijuana was regulated the same as alcohol , i do n't see why it would be a problem legal to buy and consume , just not while driving or in public ( unless in a designated establishment ) i 'd like to reiterate that i do not use drugs of any kind i just feel this issue is a no brainer and i'm shocked that there is still such hostility toward a relatively harmless plant in the information age i seriously hope you do not let personal bias override logic and fairness as it pertains to this subject it would be a real shame if normal people that do n't even use drugs had to protest a decision regarding them thank you for your time
4	he is related to me and i sent him a lenghthy email this morning i'm in my <> 's and suspect that he will call my parents about my letter that will be hilarious ! upvote !
2	i am embarrassed he is my congressman i promise i did not vote for him in the last election
6	huh ? what do you mean ? surely you know the mexican cartels make huge from their clandestine tobacco grow operations and their whiskey distilleries !
2	i find it annoying that a single member of congress has the ability to stop proposals from being permitted to be debated on the floor of congress yet they will ignore national opinion on the subject and then most citizens have to lie to have a chance at their communication getting to his office , i highly doubt he will ever get your messages nor does he care i realize that members of congress can not read all the mail they receive but i doubt they even get a summary of the content ( pro con on an issue )
2	i tend to agree i do n't use or support use of drugs in any form or fashion barring medicinal that said , i find it highly hypocritical in nature to place prohibition on cannabis when more damaging drugs such as alcohol and tobacco are freely available and widely accepted it just does n't make any sense and only shows that there are hidden and not so much agendas at play here and as for medicinal use , it is preposterous to say that there is no such occurrence every drug and or its derivatives has medical use , be it alcohol , cocaine , or heroin marijuana is no different so it would be prudent to legalize it for the sake of common sense if nothing else
1	shutting down ron pauls attempt at rational thinking in the government and barney frank 's
4	great e mail i hope you do n't mind , i just copied yours directly
1	well i do n't know about the rest of you but i called all of his offices that he has and left a message ( that i do n't think he will get ) with his secretary and left <> voice mails on the two bottom locations i hope this helps in some way i said what this guy had wrote we must keep the pressure on these ignorant money hungry politician they will either give in or give up we just have to be relentless about our peaceful actions just call or write him her it only take a few mins out of your day !

5	i left a comment on his page i am now blocked
5	i'm amazed that every single comment on his wall right now is calling him out on his " no " vote i wonder if we might actually get him to change his mind either that or how long until his wall is nothing but favorable posts from a week ago
6	link isnt working for me , and i searched his name and couldnt find it could it have been temporarily disabled or hidden ?
8	austin was split up into several separate districts ( currently three , i believe , but the proposal for the next redistricting is five districts ) , so that the democratic vote is diluted amongst the surrounding conservative rural areas
1	it actually angers me that he is ducking away like this what a cop out the fact that he is now hiding like this shows that he knows he is not acting in the best interest of anyone but a select few if he truly believed in what he did , he would be publicizing his actions , not hiding from them
2	i <> , which runs from the mexico border up through austin and san antonio , sees a lot of smuggling traffic , which means a lot of funding
1	this guy has four offices ? ! what the fuck does this asshat trouser stain need four fucking offices for ? ! last i checked texas still sucked so it does n't look like that money is doing the people of texas a whole lot of fucking good but we keep electing these assholes facepalm
1	we the people should really only have to give one stance on legalizing marijuana how in the hell can i go to the doctor and get prescribed <> <> pills of oxycodine oxycotton percocet etc with hardly even trying , yet i have to be on my death bed in order for me to get prescribed marijuana ? have these lowlife politicians ever seen the effects of pill use ? i have friends who were normal kids when we graduated high school its <> years later and you should see them now its sad and pathetic , i cant even hang out with them anymore its completely ridiculous how ignorant our " representatives " are
4	that 's hedley !

3	has anyone got a response from lamar yet ? we can bombard him all day long , but if does not respond then we will never know if his secretary is delegated to filter his email box for him he needs to be addressed in person via conference
1	email sent fuck this guy
1	it wo n't let me email the bastard ! ! ! edit i tried calling all <> of his offices and they wo n't even let me leave a message i am so pissed
2	here 's what i sent in , with a fake local zip i know lamar does n't read his own emails , that you 're just an intern or a lowly staffer , but you need to know that your boss has actively taken our country backwards you should seriously think about finding other more positive ways to spend your time than to work for a man who would rather keep spending money on the " war on drugs " then let marijuana be regulated by states drug use has not gone down , but our jail 's population has increased dramatically and we 've spent billions of dollars fighting against something that is less harmful addictive than alcohol or cigarettes you know this , because you 've probably smoked marijuana before , just like almost everyone else in this country tell him if you see him for me that he should rethink this bill for the thousands of lives that have been ruined by jail terms , families torn apart , the mexican cartels rise to dominance and a total lack of effectiveness of these policies as a man who pretends to want less government interference in his life , i would think he would see this but of course , who pays his bills ? pharmaceutical companies and liquor companies have a good day , you work for a footnote on the wrong side of history
6	how was he able to shut it down ?
6	i tried to email this guy from his website , but it forces you to put in a zip code , and then tells me i'm out of the district anyone have a legit email address ?

4	just called his dc office mailbox full good job reddit !

2	and it 's worthless actions like this that ensure that the law on marijuana wo n't change for decades to come
2	actually there is evidence see my comment in response to thejeffa above there have been <> studies done about the united states , the united states is a unique country with a unique population and a unique stigma of drug use it is impossible , i repeat , impossible to know how decrim here in the u s would compare to other countries but portugal did experience fairly significant increase in usage that trended back down over the years its still to early to tell what the long term effects will be , they are only in the first decade and the reduction in drug related deaths from the onset has already diminished back to where it was before i wrote more details in my other comment response to the jeffa i am not against decrim , i'm not defending the quote in the op , i'm just pointing out what we know and what we do n't know about what the effects might be as i said in my original comment i think the increase would be negligible , especially in the long term
6	i agree , if people want it they will get it anyway
4	good point cheezmeister the amount of people in government who have had influence on bills laws decisions that directly benefit major corporations where those who had the influence either came from or go to those same corporations is dizzying the government may as well be known as a staffing firm for the current corporatocracy just doing inter office transfers between corporations whether it is goldman sachs , monsanto , comcast , etc they come and go and make millions screwing the general public short term and long term
1	great gerrymandering genitalia ! !
6	what more of a lobby does the cannabis group need ? the last three presidents all have admitted to taking weed two out of the three actually inhaled what more endorsements do you need when presidents from both parties , partied ? for that third guy , i am not sure how you smoke w o inhaling
6	well hes right in his second quote that decriminalizing probably would lead to increased use i disagree because there is absolutely no evidence that legalization leads to increased use if you consider holland where marijuana has been excepted for quite some time you would come to the opposite conclusion because marijuana use among the dutch is less prevalent than it is among americans
2	without being fed propaganda and stigmatizations jesus , you ca n't get information about anything without it being tainted by a special interest group something like weed is never going to get a fair go
1	i ca n't believe we even have to sit here and waste our time over this there is no debate as far as i'm concerned , it 's all a bunch of political bullshit and everyone knows it
5	uhh , i hate to tell you this but the slave states were the ones opposed to states rights that 's because every time a slave escaped to the north , and a southern state wanted to force that northern state to return the slave the northern state would declare that they had no obligation to , because of states rights the southern states were deeply resentful of the northern states not returning the slaves , but the thing that really forced the succession and the resentment , and the civil war revolved around federal tariffs that kept them from competing with the north in sum , the federal government had too much control over the states

6	i 've been following politic since the <> the republican party then was just as full of nut cases as it is now there was no infiltration nixon was into big government and imperialist wars , and against civil liberties so was reagan so was ford and bush i so where are these " real " conservatives ? barry goldwater in his later years , always on the fringe of his party ?

2	all of this and more some people just have an affinity for money that i will never know , and never want to there 's a reason why so many of these people obtain elected positions most elections are won by whoever has and spends the most money for example , look at the u s presidential election it is one of the most gaudy political spectacles you will ever see in the <> u s presidential election , barrack obama bought his <> , <> , <> voters a subway cold cut combo meal john mccain was n't as wealthy and , as such , only bought his <> , <> , <> voters just the cold cut combo ( http en wikipedia org wiki fundraising for the <> united states presidential election ) i propose there be a limit to how much you can spend on election to any public office that would be so much more fun to see just hand each candidate <> and let them have at each other somewhat hard to hide your true self when there are n't fifty advisers telling you who to be and non stop television adverts smearing your opponents

5	as long as the states allow due process and provide equal rights i agree with this due process under the law is absolutely essential in a free and open society ( that was tough to type ) i'm confused by this is banning building mosques denying individual rights ? it is or is it ok because the state is going after a group ? imho it is not ok if either a state or a federal government discriminates how about jailing women for miscarriages ? this is what happens when democrats re legitimize rank and file gop
1	freedom includes the freedom to live by the rules of your community i believe no government should ban marijuana , but as the law stands , the federal government has no legitimate power to compel states to keep it legal nor does it have the legitimate power to compel most of the things it does
8	fighting is what you have to do when you have large government , because it always falls to interests of people you disagree with the fed should be as weak as practical and do only what is necessary for our national defense , and let the people of the states determine on their own the best course of action and laws for themselves
1	if you disagree with this man , look at chicago and illinois and then go fuck yourself , that is if you still disagree
8	i think you 're kind of missing the point a smaller government would allow the private sector to take over what used to be government run thus allowing them more control directly as opposed to indirectly through the government at least make them jump through some hoops and leave some evidence before they can control our lives
8	not necessarily true average lifespan was very short compared to now , but that 's largely due to extremely high infant mortality bringing the average down
2	and i value a government that works , which is why i do n't give a shit about doing anything against the one we got stuck with )
1	i grew up in la i'm well of aware of just how badly herr vitter needs to be fucking shot it sad that vitter can rise to a position of power , even in la
1	by declaring them an enemy of the state and unpatriotic then , when no one 's looking , we 'll be back to assfucking america for nickels from our paymasters the politicians claiming to be republicans
2	the difference is , the shithead in maine is just sponsoring a bill that 's fine people can sponsor a bill about whatever they like but the second it got to committee , it was rejected straight away , rejected based on his incorrect beliefs i know this shit happens all the time i'm just disgusted with it
4	yes editing my original comment to reflect that thank you
1	i just moved to austin from abilene and a few years ago we got royally fucked by tom delay when he got our congressman gerrymandered out it is a blatant attempt to take away the right of each person 's vote to count and it makes me ill that they no longer have to hide it
6	then you 're saying the republicans are in fact the majority , in which case , why complain that the representative is republican ?
2	what 's frustrating is that no one can legally refute the claim that it is dangerous or addictive because it is a schedule <> drug , which makes it difficult ( if not impossible ) to do laboratory tests or tests on human subjects the precedent has been set that it is harmful , and it is classified in such a way that you ca n't ever disprove its harmfulness i think that it needs to be re scheduled as a lower class of drug and studied , and that after we get a serious peer reviewed study that shows its relative lack of harmfulness , it should be brought to the floor of the senate having smoked marijuana many times , i acknowledge that it is harmful to a degree i would n't say that smoking is a healthful experience but that its current legal status has no relation with how harmful it is future generations will look back at us and wonder what the <> <> centuries had against thc , an arbitrary pick for the villain in a war on drugs
6	well hes right in his second quote that decriminalizing probably would lead to increased use , especially at first ( how much , there is really no way of knowing i postulate it would be pretty negligible ) and thus probably would also translate into higher profits for drug cartels agreed , that is why we need full scale legalization then it can be properly regulated , people can be properly fairly educated on it without being fed propaganda and stigmatizations , cartels lose one of their biggest cash crops , more medical research can be done freely , sufferers of the numerous current symptoms that it treats can get relief without fear of legal repercussion , people could actually get a job without worrying about a drug test that only punishes people who smoke pot ( omg it helps unemployment too ? again the effect would be very negligible but still interesting i think ) oh and for the gov it can be taxed just like cigarettes with an enforced age limit , penalties applied for smoking in public places in your car , and restricted in certain areas establishments
2	free country people who have the right to do whatever they like to themselves in a free country the government should work with the " drug cartels " of the us cannibus industry i am sure most of them would be really happy to spend more of their money on frivilous things here in the us the growers would even be willing to pay a bit of taxes on the money they spend , just so they can spend it without fear of violating some tax law lets face it , i can not fathum a us connoisseur of weed growing supporting gun running into mexico i mean seriously mexico ca n't grow good weed , period they can just grow a lot of it there would be no more money going into mexico for weed if people were allowed to grow it in their basement without fear of going to jail on a side note i believe cocaine should be legalized in the same arena except a sidebar about letting people legally bring it into the country , some sort of chemical quality control check you 'll find that the dutch do n't abuse their moderately accepted drugs it 's the people from forign countries who do n't have the option at home they travel to holland and get f ' ed up for their first time , or over dose due to ignorance
1	" the food and drug administration has not approved smoked marijuana for any condition or disease " well no shit sherlock , it 's fucking illegal !
1	how the fuck can this guy get elected ? he does n't now shit what he 's talking about
1	" state 's rights " has never been anything but dogwhistle for " fuck up the niggers and faggots "
1	we should really viral some prohibitionist lamar smith memes about the internet should know what he 's done !
1	i agree he is an asshole if marijuana has no medical uses , why is marinol , synthetic thc , legal and accepted as having medicinal uses but the natural form of the substance illegal and deemed as not having medical applications ? smith said that marijuana leads to other drugs i guess smith is n't familiar with this risk of marijuana 's ' gateway effect ' overblown http www sciencedaily com releases <> <> <> htm what a prick !
2	wow the guy sounds like a robot built in the <> 's that has n't learned anything new since then " marijuana is bad do n't do drugs stay in school " ( btw , i wrote that in robocop 's voice )
1	emailed even though only your staff will read this as you continue your ignorant campaign against common sense , i feel compelled to tell you how utter disappointed i am in your ability to rationalize and understand the world around you your recent decision against rep frank and rep paul 's recent bill hr2306 is completely unfounded marijuana use and distribution is prohibited under federal law because it has a high potential for abuse and does not have an accepted medical use in the u s , is an out right lie marijuana has never been shown to have any addictive properties and the only potential for abuse exists because it is forced into the underground market , something you are now officially perpetuating that also applies to the theory of it being a gateway drug the only thing it is a gateway to is the black market , once again because it is forced there by you and your cronies decriminalizing marijuana will only lead to millions more americans becoming addicted to drugs and greater profits for drug cartels who fund violence along the u s mexico border , is yet another complete lie around the world this has been proven wrong the dutch are known to have a massive heroin epidemic , but when the government moved to legalize that and other drugs , every single negative aspect attributable to the drug use , death , spreading disease , rising uptake by younger people declined directly as a result and they are far from the only country to try this and find the same result leaders and former leaders across the world have spoken out against this nonsense from jimmy carter to kofi annan , whom you may recognize as a former us president and the former secretary general of the un take off your blinders , stop being ignorant , and do what is right both for americans and america you make me ashamed to be a texan
8	i will concede that it is highly unlikely , and he may very well just be a staunch believer in prohibition but you cannot deny that prohibition is mainly in the best interest of drug cartels , and i'm sure they support politicians who vote to keep or strengthen such laws whether the contributions are known or unknown
4	it 's a bingo !
4	i used his home address , lol
4	nice try , intern
5	usually when a subject is n't debatable they know they will lose this upsets the hell out of me
1	where is idrawyourcomment when you need him ? !
4	thanks !
4	so finally , the internet has made a congressman delete his own facebook page achievement unlocked
1	oh fucking please god
2	oh please lulzsec , this republican is as dirty as they come
2	he leads the committee he just wo n't ever debate the bill
2	if you do n't live in his district , whatever you say write will be passed along to your local rep if you do not give your home address , it 'll be thrown out all you 're doing is creating busy work for his interns
1	well he is a dick
1	he 's a republican , he does n't have a dick worthy of a picture tiny balls too
6	do these people vote ?
2	he 's a republican , he would n't resign if there were pics of him doing scat porn with shemales in a gangbang while taking heroin and lighting <> dollar notes in the shape of the american flag on fire
6	he won last year , no opponent has come forward , and lainey melnick has not been active recently
1	norml should just contribute to his fucking campaign apparently if we just buy out the republicans we will win to the donation tin everyone ! ( http norml org index cfm ? group id <> )
5	slightly unrelated , but i love trolling strong christians with " if women were n't meant to have sex at a young age , why would god have made them sexually mature at that age ? " to this day i have yet to have a person come back with anything other than " as a test " or other bs feel free to steal this troll , just make sure the troll ee does n't think you 're a pedo that could end badly
2	slippery slope arguments " allowing x would be ok but for the fact that y and z could happen thereafter "
1	" i am not a member of representative your district , however i and many thousands of internet users have collectively decried your senseless killing of the bill hr2306 it is quite apparent that your position is based on the tautology that marijuana is bad because it 's bad the only reasons you cite are all either false or only true because the government actively quashes any domestic research that would lead to the obvious answer that marijuana is far less of a domestic health concern than alcohol , and in fact has several valid medicinal uses , as well as being the most harmless recreational substance consumed by human beings far less harmful to one 's health than alcohol , tobacco or even caffeine your statement that marijuana leads to other drugs is one of the biggest fallacies spread by politicians in an attempt to scare parents the causation and correlation here is beyond gummed up currently yes marijuana leads to other drugs this is not due to the substance itself but due to the underground black market culture to which the government has relegated it 's sale and cultivation marijuana does not lead to other drugs , spending too much time dealing with criminals does legalizing marijuana would solve that problem pretty fast i further question the logic of why , in these economic times , a republican would oppose the creation of a multibillion dollar industry which could lead to an immense revenue stream for the federal government legalization would literally bring the mexican drug cartels to their knees it is quite obvious that supporters of the war on drugs do not have the public 's best interest at heart as it only perpetuates crime and costs the american taxpayers billions of wasted dollars your conduct reveals an utter desire to remain in your seat instead of a willingness to do what 's right and practical "
6	what did he say ? i ca n't find a link
6	" if you are unqualified your vote is dismissed " ? how would you get elected if you 're an expert stoner ?
6	ya they all moved to vegas what kind of super awesome town would the cartels make
2	first thing to do is follow the money , you can look at that here ( http www opensecrets org politicians summary php ? cid n00001811 & cycle <> ) you 'll see that in <> <> campaign his <> biggest contributor was lawyers , i doubt they want less laws i hear numbers that <> of people in our prisons are there for drug violations , lawyers would lose a large part of their business those with enough money do n't go to jail for drug violations his fifth largest contributor is the drug companies combining contributions for the two accounts for about <> <> of the money he raised for the campaign the two combined would make them his largest contributor we do n't know how much benefit he received by junkets , jobs for family friends , briefcase of cash , etc i find it suspicious not to see security military organizations listed in his top twenty contributors border states also love to use marijuana to vilify immigrants , this played a part in originally making marijuana illegal
2	and hence lies the problem tobacco companies i'm sure have done studies on the feasibility of growing and distributing mj but they know that if it was legal that anyone could grow it , and cut into their profits they could n't be guaranteed a sole line of distribution like they have with cigarettes so of course they lobby against it
6	if a tobacco company decided that they wanted to start growing and selling mj why do n't they ? the government seems intent on shutting them down would n't they like a market to move into ? why are n't tobacco companies lobbying for marijuana legalization ?
8	yeah , but look at the district map he also represents bandera and comal counties , as well as a large swath of the hill country all of which have large populations of poor , white christian voters as a san antonio resident , i feel your pain just do n't forget this asshole 's name on voting day
3	" i want smaller federal government except when it comes to gay marriage , abortion , and marijuana legalization " do n't forget about religion , language , and the first and fourth amendments
1	pester his interns that 'll teach him ! !
1	maybe , but he 'll definitely give a flying fuck if every one of his branch phones are ringing off the hook and all his mailboxes are full and cant hear people from the <>
6	he is chairman of the committee , he has decided that the bill wo n't be heard how is it naive to believe that he is stopping this ?
6	it 's pretty amazing how long the gop has been able to use that line and continually act in the exact opposite way , without any significant number of their electorate adherents noticing
2	this ia exactly the problem with our news media they parrot politicians ' rhetoric instead of reporting what they 're actually doing
6	you know , he may never read a single email letter we send him , but there is one group of people that can really attract his attention lulzsec , do us a favor prove that you 're useful
4	i find it amusing you think this will do anything what do you think matters more to this guy , the millions he makes by staying in good with the tobacco , pharmacy , and alcohol industries , or the few thousand emails his staff will have to sift through
1	this guy 's district contains the richest parts of austin damn tom delay and his partisan redistricting of texas damn lamar smith and his shit eating grin
1	he probably keeps his stash in the basement of the alamo fucking hypocrite
6	like he 's going to give <> shits what us commoners think
4	interesting the us government has a patent on the use of cannabis for medical treatment two faced rat fucking bastards sorry , the mask slipped a bit
2	i'm not a pot smoker but this pisses me off smoking pot is way less dangerous than drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes , and all the myths are out there to keep pot illegal kills brain cells , etc
2	texas the reason why the u s ca n't have nice things
5	just emailed my rep and both my senators i am not optimistic on the effects , but i feel a little better knowing i gave my two cents it would help if they gave a damn what we had to say
6	so , you agree with china then that they merely have a different definition of freedom ? that we evil americans should n't insist on the freedom of people to say what they want , because in china they merely believe in the " freedom " not to have their minds contaminated by different thoughts ? yesh remind me to never , ever , count on libertarians to be allies in any fight for freedom
6	hrm looks like the removed the posts off the wall and put up his own propaganda
3	someone entice anon to attack
6	most chill place on the planet ? hah nowhere else do i find people as rabid about their opinions
4	i like how he shoots down the regulation of marijuana , however i just read yesterday about the <> some odd tigers they have in texas alone gtfo
6	i would think an ex toker like him would be ok with this i guess money from the pic is more important these days
6	will the reddit community actually do anything ? i'm willing and able to assist with whatever needs
2	r politics , " the most chill place on the planet " ? suddenly , i want to quit smoking weed
6	ah , i see well in the spirit of missing the joke , i should also point out that one of the co sponsors of the bill is a representative in texas
4	wow , the " <> , try once more " rule of thumb seems to be quite borked today
2	sure , the conservative vote is somewhat diluted too lamar smith was elected with only <> of the vote last election instead of the <> he would have gotten if austin were n't part of his district since american elections are first past the post , that kind of dilution does n't weaken his political position at all
5	sad part is , i live in la and i 've met david vitter he 's definitely a pompus ass i showed up at a restaurant to listen to him speak since my dad is a councilman and was invited to attend while he was giving his speech , he was talking about family values and such so i texted my dad and said " i wonder if he was thinking about his family values while he was screwing all those whores in the dc prostitution ring " he lol 'd
6	that may be true , but correlation does not imply causation
2	that 's nice i value equal representation , so i'm not going to commit light fraud
4	i'm glad to hear there 's <> people in the house , so i figured that odds are you were n't
4	fyi you are the target of a r libertarian crosspost downvote party http www reddit com r libertarian comments i889f rpolitics on states rightsfacepalm hi r libertarian , welcome to the party and please try to add something other than a flood of up down votes
3	in the past probably right now more than ever , we need them because the federal government is even more out of touch than the states
4	welcome to politics
6	did you miss the cheney administration ?
2	he 's a republican douchebag with a long history of douchebaggery this would be the exact thing to expect from lamar smith he gets elected because republican douchebaggery continues to have a strong voice in texas check out rick perry 's current god shit oh , and tom delay ? ' nuff said
2	if you do n't live in his district , whatever you say write will be passed along to your local rep if you do not give your home address , it 'll be thrown out all you 're doing is creating busy work for his interns
2	they have either made the profile private already or deleted it , i ca n't get facistbook to go there at all
1	come on , i seriously doubt that as someone who lives in austin , smith may be a total douchebag , but he is n't a pawn for the drug cartels if you 're going to make a wild accusation like that , at least back it up with some data
1	i am in his district he is n't he 's just a doofus dumbass
4	being close to the border , this guy is probably in the pocket of the cartels himself ding ding ding ! we have a winner !
6	i just want to point out that i hardly drink alcohol anymore after becoming a pot head seriously , i cant believe people are afraid of pot
4	there 's little to know lamar smith is a texan republican in the rick perry vein it is absolutely no surprise to anyone , particularly from central texas , that he said what he said and did what he did feel free to reason all you want with these people i 'll even bet he could finish your statements for you wo n't matter , because he 's a texas neocon , corporatist , pseudo conservative , christian " values " douchebag no different than rick perry or tom delay he will act accordingly
5	what 's annoying me more is that he 's a politician openly stating what he based his decision on , which are essentially unsubstantiated and wrong facts , everything he said was shit tier science i wouldnt care if this bill wouldnt pass , as long as there is a good reason not to , however , the fact that everything he said can be discredited as false reasoning makes me rage at the thought that openly unqualified people are enabled to decide on shit like this seriously , would it be too much to ask for a system for politicians that says " if you are unqualified your vote is dismissed " ? how the fuck is this happening ? laws with federal wide impact being decided on reasoning that has been proven false for fucking decades raaaage
6	i checked out his issues page , he seems to be the most generic person ever does n't even mention drugs so i do n't really understand why he 's so invested in keeping marijuana illegal
3	because the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms has done a ( hypothetical ) study that proves it is nessecary for the federal government to regulate guns for whatever reason ( i know , bad example , its the point that counts ) it is a bad example i do n't think you could really prove that federal gun regulation is better than state given that , most gun regulation is done by the states then would he believe in state rights ? yes
2	he 's a hypocrite of the worst kind and a corporate shill in congressional clothing there you now know all you 'll ever need to know about this shithead
8	sounds a lot like 'if we allow gay marriage , soon men will be able to marry little girls ' argument which republicans favor granted , if people took the time to read their laws , men are already allowed to marry little girls if her parents approve , making this ' argument ' against gay marriage all the more pathetic
4	i love how these clowns can make streaming movies a felony because that is apparently a " bi partisan issue , " but as soon as something lacking a giant lobby comes across their desk it ca n't even make it to the floor for a vote and to kill it by citing illogical , disproven nonsense just salts the wounds if a tobacco company decided that they wanted to start growing and selling mj , this asshole would draft a decriminalization bill tomorrow and he 'd probably throw in a nice tax break and a few subsidies in the process
2	if that one single goofy looking congressman stopped it , then the bill had no legs anyway it 's so silly to blame one dude for halting the legislation by silly , i mean naive
1	just so you know , bush is from connecticut ( http politicalhumor about com library images blbushconnecticutwelcome htm ) but yeah , a lot of fucktards come from here
1	be polite !
2	this story should be " congressman on the take from prison and beer companies shuts down debate on drug war "
1	i find shit like this to be fucked up beyond measure we elect these cocksuckers to represent the will of the people and all they end up doing is representing their own ideas and pushing their own beliefs through government seriously , get out of your cocoon of ignorance , realize why you were elected , and do your job prick
6	wow , that ended a lot sooner than expected okay folks , now is the time to pool our efforts in a productive manner might i suggest we contact the news radio station listed on his facebook page , w o a i ( http radio woai com pages contactus html ) and unanimously voice our thoughts on what has transpired perhaps someone knows someone in the san antonio area with news media contacts ?
1	nothing will change the peoples desire to use marijuana , and right now everyone who wants it can get it the only people who loose are those unlucky enough to get caught , and government tax revenue not collected i really do want to pay taxes !
4	email sent ! ! !
6	i know this is the most chill place on the planet you lost , bro ?
1	fuck you texas ! and fuck your lone star beer !
1	dang , his san antonio office is like <> minutes from my parents might have to havea mini picket protest ( aka just me ) next time i go visit that 'll show him !
2	his facebook page http www facebook com lamarsmithtx21 ? sk wall you have to " like " him temporarily to post to his wall
4	g 'd ay , sir there 's some opportunity in your body of work today
1	true liberty is not derived from being a member of some protected group all citizens deserve the same protections , regardless of whatever ethnic or other subgroup they happen to be in exactly that 's what the real constitution guarantees , and that 's what the fake state pseudo constitutions do n't to begin with ( texas explicitly forbids me from holding office ) and since they can be changed at the whim of a simple majority they can never be said to really protect rights
1	any rights not specifically delineated to the federal government are reserved by the states as long as the states allow due process and provide equal rights true liberty is not derived from being a member of some protected group all citizens deserve the same protections , regardless of whatever ethnic or other subgroup they happen to be in that 's real liberty , not liberty defined by demographic i'm confused by this is banning building mosques denying individual rights ? or is it ok because the state is going after a group ? how about jailing women for miscarriages ?
1	any rights not specifically delineated to the federal government are reserved by the states states are n't people states are governments people have rights , governments have powers the tenth amendment states the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people you 'll notice it uses the word " powers " , not " rights " that " states rights " advocates make their case using this highly orwellian term is red flag number one that they consistently fail to acknowledge the " or to the people " clause , as well as the entirety of the ninth amendment , is red flag number two as per the constitution , us citizens have rights , both enumerated in the bill of rights and non enumerated the federal government is granted powers states get the powers not delegated to the federal government but still ca n't violate individual rights the federal government has consistently though imperfectly been a better protector of individual rights and the equal protection thereof than the states
2	i also think that decentralized government gives the people the most power to fight for what they want and believe in , which is what liberty is about i think you have an odd definition of liberty liberty is about living free fighting is what you do when you do n't have liberty
1	why ? freedom is universal , or it is n't freedom why should changing postal districts have anything , anything at all , to do with what freedoms i have ? i am a citizen of the nation called the united states of america , i expect certain freedoms to exist wherever i go within that nation i do not , and should not , expect that my freedoms will be curtailed just because i change zip codes how about we set it up so you do n't have to move to another postal district just because some people in that area are fucktards ? why bother with a constitution if we 're going to rule that the postal districts can wipe their asses with it and deny us the freedoms enshrined therein ?
6	look how huge our gov ' t is now guess who controls our gov ' t corporations
2	er , that makes you an anti federalist
3	limited government is really based on the idea that people will stand up and " govern " things if you deprive them of the governmental parental figure corporations ca n't control things if people do n't give them their money is the idea and if people could n't rely on the government to monitor and protect them then they would take that upon themselves for instance if reddit users decided a corporation was performing evil deeds they would spread the word via reddit and then on to their friends and families it 's the idea of participation and self governance , that we the people need to take charge of our own lives even us die hard libertarians realize this would take time and a shifting of culture , but it used to work fairly well for as limited as communications and civilian collaboration was , but i think with today 's technology it 's actually a " long term " viable solution
6	huh ? what , do you think the fed 's weed prohibition is protecting you from the big bad corporations ( which ones , exactly , and what precisely do they control ) ? no , seriously , you really think the government is the last bastion between relative freedom and corporate dystopia ? heck , corporations already control the government through lobbies and other bs that i ca n't believe we tolerate just look at this pinhead 's campaign contributions ( http www opensecrets org politicians summary php ? cid n00001811 ) i do n't know who else is in lamar 's pocket , but i can guarantee you it 's not bob marley corporations cannot , however , control you and me , with only two exceptions by vegatative zombification through ads , or indirectly through the government as mentioned limited government prevents corporations controlling everything by preventing the government from controlling everything your comment is a contradiction on several levels tl dr think for yourself , foo ' , do n't let uncle sam do it for you and think before you comment ( or vote ) rant over come to think of it , perhaps all we need is a good cannabis lobby redditors , feel like collectively bribing some government officials ?
8	limited government with corporate control is n't that bad , they just cannot be above the laws set by the people they have to be accountable perhaps even more accountable than any civilian
6	i read the supposedly " bonkers " post and i do n't know what people are complaining about , so perhaps someone could explain this to me the problem with adams is i do n't really know what he 's trying to get at and the problem with jezebel is she 's a knee jerk reactionist who is only adept at creating strawmen their arguments stink they do n't understand each other i do n't understand them it 's just a bunch of babble punctuated by talking past each other maybe one day they 'll stop pontificating about shit that does n't make sense and ask each other questions to get to the heart of the matter , but for now i see two people talking just to hear themselves talk
4	i 've long been suspicious of adams and his intentions as a comic artist , and never much of a fan of dilbert ( even before i thought of the strip or adams in a political sense ) i do recommend this book about dilbert , though i have it and would give it <> <> stars definitely worth the read , and in light of some of adams ' recent bullshit , i think the author 's conclusions hit the mark more than ever http www amazon com trouble dilbert corporate culture laugh dp <> ref sr <> <> ? s books & ie utf8 & qid <> & sr <> <>
2	the jezebel post is pure feminist bile the first comment is especially funny , because he babbles about how women are " subjugated into a lack of education " when in reality women are earning college degrees at a higher rate than men are there is no serious denial of the mental ability of women anymore , at least not in professional and educational venues maybe down at the bar in any case , adams is a jackass our capacity for thought as a species would take us beyond what people call our " nature " if we would only foster that growth
5	i know i 'll live to regret this ( well maybe i 'll live ) , but i'm in total agreement with williams when talking about present day western society i'm in total agreement with adams when talking about the whole of humanity over the whole of known history face it , we 're mostly the descendents of rapists
2	i think adams has said some dumb things at times , but williams is absolutely bound and determined to misrepresent misinterpret every single thing he says if she 's so convinced he 's wrong , then she should try to have an adult debate and let him hang himself right now she 's muddling it and not accomplishing anything besides making publicity for herself
2	gosh i knew scott adams was frequently pompous and stupid one of those embarrassing cases of a creator being a disappointment in comparison with his creations but i would have thought that if he was going to discuss the topic of rape , he would try to do it in an informed way , and with at least some respect i guess i gave him too much credit he comes across as feeling that because he thinks he is very clever and rational , he does n't actually have to be polite or engage with other people 's arguments in good faith it 's pretty loathsome to see him being , by turns , facetious and cranky about something so sensitive and important called on his ignorance and entitled navel gazing , he squirms through the old " i'm just a comedian " defense , then tries to pretend that he is the rational man ( " the science is on my side " um , no , scott , you clearly do n't know the first thing about rape ) what a horrible , horrible person
1	right media ethics has gone out the window over the past <> years , but that 's because it is a business and this is what they think is a more profitable business model , pandering bullshit and sensationalism gets them higher ratings than investigative journalism and rational thought
6	wow they 're really terrified of him becoming popular
2	not that it will do any good , but i did send a complaint to cnn
8	the article also has more text about mitt romney , who is n't even participating
8	the " leadership " at cnn obviously hate ron paul they bad mouth and ignore him every chance they get ron paul is the only republican who can beat obama , he should sue cnn
6	looks like it 's been fixed
6	at the same time cnn did a good interview with ron paul at their last rnc debate and he was the only one that was interviewed after what 's your game plan here cnn ?
1	what is wrong with cnn ? they use to be good and have been going downhill since they started l
8	that 's fine as long as the watchers of cnn know their opinions are being manipulated
1	you obviously have no clue how law suits work they have no legal obligation to cover him , mention his name , show his picture anything if they want to ignore him , they have every " right " to

6	yes what if tootheless unemployed beer swilling rednecks stopped producing ? what if old medicare recipients stopped being captains of industry ? if conservatives " go galt " nothing will happen you fucktards do n't contribute anything anyway
5	the plot of rand s novel is simple , despite its length <> , <> pages in the current paperback edition the united states is governed by bureaucrats , looters and moochers , who penalize and demonize creative people the country is in decline because creative people are disappearing they have followed the innovative john galt to a mountain enclave , galt s gulch , where they watch society crumble creativity has gone on strike ( the working title of the novel was the strike ) , and the engine of capitalism cannot run without it oh for the simple times where the us was n't mixed in the web of global trade and politics

2	when he does n't have to worry about re election ? i think he 'll be much less conservative presidents always get more stuff done in their second term , when they no longer have to keep the independent voters happy
3	but not marriage do n't forget that part
2	the had it long enough to change the rules , and did not , because they wanted to be able to turn around and filibuster when they were next in the minority
8	marriage as defined between two people , i am also not religious & would have a nonreligious ceremony whenever i get married my opinion is that there should be a difference between religious marriages , for those who want them , and a nonsecular marriages in that if certain religious officiants did n't want to participate in same sex marriages , they would n't have to , so that they might not be so against it point being , to call it all " marriage " & let the couples decide if they want it religious or not
1	so , if marriage is only about the offspring , i guess we ca n't let old people or infertile couples get married right ? and we 'll have to start fertility testing couples before they get married basically , your opinion comes down to not letting them have equal rights ( and do keep in mind they pay for some of these rights in taxes just like you do ) , because they 're icky by your standards none of your last bit has anything to do with biology or right to marriage some has to do with social issues that need to be dealt with i find it really funny people like you cite the whole disease thing , because we do n't use physical fitness as a measure of whether someone can get married , and you lot seem to think that if people can make legally binding relationships , where cheating is generally discouraged on a societal level , that it 'll spread more disease can you not see that this opinion is constructed with very poor logic ? and apparently , since you 're rolling out the lisp and clothing styles , we 're to judge people based on stereotypes ? i 've met plenty of gay men who do n't conform to any of that , same for lesbians and the way people talk and dress has nothing to do with their ability to get married nudists marry , people who wear god awful clothing from the <> 's marry , hell , even hipsters can get married ! who the hell cares what kind of clothes people wear ? you 're talking about how a group of people should n't have rights because you find that group of people gross , and now you 're complaining about being downvoted in an extremely passive aggressive manner because people do n't share your opinion that seems reasonable oh and the ad hominem at the end was just spiffy nice parting shot really
4	it 's pretty exciting having a triangulating president like clinton or obama , is n't it ? i never know if he 's selling us up the river because he 's against the progressive agenda or because he 's trying to appease the swing voters did he throw us under the bus because of moral conviction or because he wants to win the election ? who can say ? !
2	which they never had for any extended period of time
6	as much as i ca n't stand the republican party at times , i find them the lesser of the two evils i find they are a bit more grounded , at least for the time being , in reality a pox on both their houses
2	reading is hard clearly , as the citation you asked for , the filibuster proof majority , has nothing to do with the simple majority required for a rules change of which i spoke
1	i blame them both but then the whole discussion on why you should choose the lesser of two evils erupts and i lose interest
1	uh huh , anyone who opposes obama 's policies is " racist " never heard that one before
2	i disagree i think voting for the lesser evil because you think a decent candidate will lose is the cowards way out and why we are in this mess to begin with in short , we will continue to fail as a nation because we are too spineless to fight for what is right
4	also , i think other states agree to recognize any marriage that a recognized political entity recognizes ( or maybe just other states ) this is why if you get married in las vegas , you can still go to north dakota and be considered married my uncle and aunt were married in ireland but are considered married in texas
1	so we should allow parties a and b to shut us down because that is the way they want it ? fuck a whole bunch of that i wont vote for democrats or republicans if that means i lose so be it at least i chose what was right instead of continuing to allow them to think we care about or need them
6	i do n't know about them but what do you think about the grass roots tau party ?
6	in plenty of interviews , he said he believed in civil unions that are remarkably similar to marriage , but not marriage itself however , he may have certainly changed his mind recently
1	not only priority , i say just fuck the term marriage marriage is a religious term right ? like getting married is all about going to the church and getting a priest to say stuff about how god approves is that what gays are fighting for ? approval of god ?

2	civil rights , unless you 're a white straight male , have n't been won easily for anyone as a white male who is married to a black woman , i disagree people like myself , too , had to fight for against anti miscegenation laws of the jim crow period prior to <> i could n't have married the love of my life
1	how would that even work , though ? when two things are exactly the same , you call them the same on top of it all gay people are n't going to go around saying " yeah , we got civil unioned ! " they 're going to say " we got married ! " all the sane people are going to use the m word too the bigots are n't going to call it marriage , but would they anyway ?
6	so it 's a separate , but equal institution ? man , where have i heard that before
2	so when he comes to visit he can use the colored toilet out back because it 's " remarkably similar " to the toilet inside the house , but not the nice , clean , white people 's toilet itself oh , but that is n't a fair comparison , is it ? because being told where to take a crap is an issue worth marching in the streets for because being told you ca n't sit at the lunch counter is so offensive that it 's worth a bunch of white kids coming down from the north to help protest the issue because being told you ca n't drink out of a water fountain is an issue worth dying over but being told you ca n't marry your life long partner ? no big deal being told you ca n't visit your dying second class civil unified but not spouse in the hospital ? just an inconvenience get over it
2	this is exactly what should be employed in the us i always found it ridiculous that the religious institution of marriage had any legal status i doubt this will happen the only way we 'll achieve equality is by allowing gay people to marry
8	while it is correct that " marriage " still does require a separate action to gain status for same sex couples , some of the exact same issues that exist in the us exist in germany adoption rules , insemination is hugely difficult for couples to obtain , as well as insurance , inheritance , and tax laws a good summary of what advocacy groups in germany point out is linked to below here http lib ohchr org hrbodies upr documents session4 de ilga deu upr s4 <> ilga etal joint pdf
2	i am a christian , and believe homosexuality is a sin i believe everybody should have civil unions , and there should be no legal recognition for marriage this entire debacle is because of marriage having anything to do with the state
6	curious as to what stops people from taking advantage of this though what stops <> same gender roomates from filing for a civil union just to get tax breaks and benefits ?
7	did n't seem to be such a huge problem for loving v virginia of course , back then supreme court justices upheld the constitution
6	that 's very interesting ( and depressing ) do you know if the kentucky amendment has ever been challenged as unconstitutional on the federal level ? from what i recall , the supreme court seems to be ok with reserving " marriage " to hetero couples , but is very uncomfortable with anything preventing people from enjoying equal rights
6	just like restrooms ?
6	just like restrooms ?
2	technically what it comes down to is shared property and property is taxed also , the " tax breaks " are only for some people and it 's entirely based on the combined income some people pay more when they get married , some people pay less , some people pay about the same the only really unfair thing about marriage is that specific government employees get paid more for being married and those would be people serving in the armed forces and obviously gays in the military could not get married , so that would be the most unfair area
6	the right to marry , maybe ?
2	so after congress passes a bill that the obama administration was heavily lobbying for and was immediately signed into law , that 's " too little too late ? " by your standard , no president deserves credit for any legislation passed during their term
7	i do n't think so you 'll never see gay marriage go one way or another for a long , long time the same as abortion if it were so , the democrats and republicans would lose these excellent non issues they like to use to draw in voters who support meaningless social issues over the health of the economy that is , the health of everyone , not just a small niche
6	ron paul also believes that the first amendment is there to guarantee your right to practice your christian religion in the public square ( http transcripts cnn com transcripts <> <> se <> html ) , and has nothing to do with separation of church and state king congressman paul , does faith have a role in these public issues , the public square , or is it a personal issue at your home and in your church ? paul i think faith has something to do with the character of the people that represent us , and law should have a moral fiber to it and our leaders should we should n't expect us to try to change morality you ca n't teach people how to be moral but the constitution addresses this by saying literally , it says no theocracy but it does n't talk about church and state the most important thing is the first amendment congress shall write no laws which means congress should never prohibit the expression of your christian faith in a public place
2	keep in mind whatever he does it will always be subject to political expediency remember he directed the doj to oppose a legal challenge to do n't ask , do n't tell by the logcabin republicans so he could get the measure , which had bipartisan support , to pass in congress clearly repealing do n't ask do n't tell is a good cause , but an even better cause is repealing it and getting part of the credit
2	it 's all talk until he starts pushing for legislation and signs on the bottom line
2	he did that on purpose because his orders could be recinded by a future president he wanted a more permanent solution i know this because he said so

8	so do single people
4	my decision to vote for him again is still evolving
4	i think if he gets re elected , he 'll come out in favor of gay marriage
1	it 's all bullshit because the campaign is winding up again lies , lies , lies
1	then fucking do something about it
1	soooooooooooo many people on here making excuses for the guy he said everything possible he could short of calling for " marriage " that 's pathetic just move to legalize it and american 's short attention span will forget about it before the <> election they 'll be more worried about <> <> gallon petrol to worry about homosexual marriage just legalize it already !
5	yeah , this is what really bothers me and , like you , i lose interest
2	it 's called full faith and credit ( http en wikipedia org wiki full faith and credit clause ) and it should do what you suggest unfortunately the defense of marriage act ( and similar state laws ) explicitly deny this constitutionally protected right and while obama will not defend the act it is still the law of the land until it can be struck down as unconstitutional or repealed by congress
3	bravery and cowardice have nothing to do with it choose to be realistic and effective we are in this mess , because a lot of people do n't agree with our views if redditors formed the whole electorate , the ' broken system ' would start putting forth a lot of positive change be a tough guy in the democratic primary instead of hiding your head in the sand and voting green third parties do n't work here and it 's far easier to shift the democrats left rather than overhaul the whole system , which would n't happen without a legislative supermajority anyway
6	how do you get that from what i said ? you can oppose his policies but if the opposition is not based on rationality , evidence , and some basis in reality then i get to call you a racist in this case some fuck hates obama for doing exactly what he said he would do in this case obama made a perfectly well reasoned argument for why he chose the approach he did and it makes perfect sense
8	the issue is the " validated by the state " part that 's what the whole fight is about the state should n't have to validate a contract for it to be enforceable the state should n't have to validate a private marriage contract anyway , i tend to agree with your point on equal protection under the law since government benefits are associated with these licenses but when you compare ron paul 's position , which is get government out of the equation , and obama 's position which is some kind of government mandated separate but equal status , i think ron paul 's position is much more favorable for equality
4	i feel the same way , & i 'd vote for the person who shares my beliefs , whichever party they belong to ( dems & repubs will always win , due to a majority of people voting for those two ) i was just stating that neither dems or repub would be likely to openly state that , but if one did , that would be the person i 'd vote for , providing i also shared their other beliefs if a minority party candidate best represented me , i 'd vote for them
8	they 're the enthusiasts of party a who want to take its masters and move in a dangerous direction for it they themselves are controlled by big business who want to gain more control over party a
2	i do n't believe that political parties should exist , and in the constitution , it never mentions what to do with them the structure of the congress as it exists today is a result of the bipartisan system from jefferson to jackson , there was really only one party the federalists were a joke it took brave souls to form the whigs to counter the democrats , and that eventually became the corrupt gop the democrats later became liberals , but that does n't mean they 're not corrupt
1	correction gay couples have same rights as all the issue is if the government will recognize them
6	he pushed for " do n't ask , do n't tell " to be repealed successfully i do n't understand what you are talking about can you explain more ?
2	well , no one believes them , but it 's not about whether you truly believe it , it 's about whether you vote for party a or party b
4	i'm just glad these children were here today to witness this display of authentic frontier gibberish
1	his actions in office do not disagree with his statements in the submitted article i'm sure the guy who pushed for the repeal of the dadt policy is secretly plotting some anti homosexual agenda
1	his actions in office do not disagree with his statements in the submitted article i'm sure the guy who pushed for the repeal of the dadt policy is secretly plotting some anti homosexual agenda

1	i got civil unionated in vermont ( which to dissolve requires one of us to live in vermont for a whole year ) to my ex husband we moved to the uk ( he 's a uk national ) i came back and moved to colorado i swear to hastur that i have to stare at any form asking my marital status for about half an hour before i figure out that i'm single legally speaking immigration and doma make things really confusing and kind of dumb
8	if a unioned gay couple from another country ( let 's just use canada as an example ) tried to move to the us , then yes , their marriage would not be accepted same if a couple from iowa tried to move to nebraska , i 'd imagine nebraska does n't recognize homosexual marriage , so the marriage would be invalid that 's just what i understand , but i have n't brushed up on the subject too much recently
1	so if obama magically takes control of the legislative branch and declares that gay marriage is now a constitutionally protected right you 'll belittle the accomplishment by saying it 's nothing because it should n't have been prohibited in the first place ? are you fucking serious ?
4	very good point
3	they do when you have enough votes to eliminate filibuster and choose not to
5	oh , absolutely but , my point is there is no " sides " if you had just mentioned your conservative views without degrading a particular party , i just feel that carries more weight but , i concede that you are indeed correct in the marvelously logical world of commenting there are talking point that can be used to grasp at the ear of the party you are reaching for i unfortunately , refuse to separate logical discussion from commenting i try with all my might to not allow ideology and emotion govern any of the topics i speak upon which makes sometimes for bored , and temperamental listeners but , long is the road
6	i know some people will never be happy with anything president obama does , but i 'd expect to see those folks on fox news
6	uh , yeah , that 's the point are you saying that because dadt was a bad law obama should n't get any credit for repealing it ? really ?
8	and this is different from republicans , how ? do n't blame all that on " democrats "
8	they also never technically controlled the senate , because those numbers always included joe lieberman as a " democrat " when he 's actually an independent ( the democrats kicked him out ) , and he 's really a republican representing israel
3	they do when you have enough votes to eliminate filibuster and choose not to
2	you can tell it 's election time again when he 's pro gay marriage rights i imagine he 'll downplay the deportations and start giving lip service to immigration reform again next
1	legally this whole issue would be over in a week if someone just asked " well lets give civil unions the same legal basis as we do marriages " done
6	that was his position during the <> elections however , he has said his views are " evolving " he has instructed the justice department to stop defending doma at this point , we just have to wait and see what his position will be in time for the <> elections
8	no one wants to force churches to marry homosexuals they want their civil marriage to be recognised by the state and legal with all the federal rights that come with it no , the contention here is expressly due to the demonstrably and patently wrong notion that religions alone own and can define marriage this has nothing to do with religious marriage , and everything to do with civil marriage that 's all that has ever been asked for some homosexuals may want their denominations to marry them , but that has n't been on any state or federal legislation and is certainly a pipedream , as it would be wrong to force churches to marry people they do not want to yes , it probably is n't a big deal to you , seeing as you do n't even have a working knowledge on the issue , but you know what is worse than " whiney " people wanting the same civil rights ? people who it does n't affect waving their privilege in your face saying it 's not a big deal and you 're just a <> minority so take the fucking backseat a right delayed is a right denied and you will not tell me how big of a deal it is for me
1	but they do n't even have the se rights as a same sex couple yet
6	same , but different i really do n't understand why he has this stance against gay marriage especially as a black man you think black people would see the plight of the gay 's and remember some things that happened in the <> 's
1	well , i actually think it makes sense for the term ' marriage ' to be scrapped in government it 's a religious term with religious connotations you should receive a state civil union license that allows you to share resources and binds you to the person for policies in short , gives you what marriage rights give people now can be used for any adult to bind to any other adult it would be a simple legal matter you sign paperwork , your partner signs paperwork , and that 's notarized and submitted to the state then if you want to get ' married ' in the eyes of religion , you need to follow the traditions of your chosen religion you could be married in a religious sense , but not have a civil union and vise versa you could be ' married ' to several people through the eyes of your religion , but only bound to a single one in the eyes of the state it makes sense and it takes religious connotations out of the law also , a minor could be ' married ' in the eyes of the religion , but have no state rights until a contract can be entered into in the eyes of a law
8	because it 's political suicide now it 's too polarizing an issue to be worth addressing , especially with an election coming up aside from that , his stance is utterly irrelvant , he 's not the one who decides that take that up with congress
2	oh he 's for it but being a politician and all , he 's publicly against it until he feels sure that it wo n't kill his ( or his party 's ) re election chances socially liberal states like maine and california only recently disapproved of gay marriage even if by narrow margins i think that the electoral map is still in the favor of the gop if he were to make a campaign issue of it which does nobody any good but that 'll change in time
8	do n't tell everyone , but i did say that in <> i have n't changed i'm still pro fiscal responsibility , and anti bullshit currently ron paul 's got my vote because no one can really say with any real weight that the man flip flops on much i may not agree with everything he says , but if we 're honest he 's the least full of bullshit of them all
4	oh good , i was worried someone might make a point without turning it into a meme thanks !
1	he wants to get re elected stance explained the coward
2	he said his own faith precludes it ( presidents have to kowtow to religious nuts ) , but that his own faith has nothing to do with policy
6	separate , but equal come on how can you miss that
6	he said it 's because of his religion so that must be true , right ?
6	separate , but equal come on how can you miss that
6	purely political reasons dan savage , i think , nails it ( http slog thestranger com slog archives <> <> <> barack obamas devolution on marriage equality ) before i risk publicly disagreeing with " some strategists " let me say with this i think the president should come out in support of marriage equality i think everyone should and i believe obama supported marriage equality in <> , and i think he supports it now but i also believe that barack obama will pay a political price a potentially determinative price if he endorses marriage equality before the <> election because republicans who support marriage equality are n't going to vote for barack obama in <> just because he came out for marriage equality but democrats who do n't support marriage equality are likely to vote against obama if he does obama 's team , i expect , realizes this ( they 're probably polling it as i type ) , and their mission is to get the president reelected our mission is to secure our full civil equality and i do n't see how a romney bachmann administration gets us closer to that goal the country is moving our way , time is on our side , and i expect that obama 's kabuki evolution will pick up a serious head of steam sometime in january of <> who knows ? the president could wind up evolving all the way back to <> andrew sullivan ( http andrewsullivan thedailybeast com <> <> obama to fake changing mind html ) and ezra klein ( http www washingtonpost com blogs ezra klein post change we can facilitate in <> <> <> agwy12fh blog html ? wprss ezra klein ) also have interesting thoughts building on that
8	honestly , probably because he has an election coming up , and he does n't want to support anything " too radical " until he knows he has a second term
2	he said he wants to give them " civil unions " that would give the exact same rights , then leave it up to churches to decide if they want to recognize it as a marriage or not essentially he says as president , it 's his job to focus on the legal rights and not get bogged down with semantics like if calling it a " civil union " is the same or worse than calling it a " marriage , " that as president , all he cares about is making sure the two groups have exactly the same rights http www youtube com watch ? v <> pe1mz8
2	because he wants to appeal to everyone walk around talking about gays " deserving the same rights " and the next day oppose gay marriage
3	it is n't only wall st that has big contributors that can influence politicians
2	he has n't talked much about this since the fundraisers <> years ago all bark , no bite
6	yahoo news eh ?
1	yeah obama ? well why do n't you do something about it !
1	fucking bullshit fuck i hate this country
6	what were those people yelling ?
6	did n't he veto the bill dealing with gay people and their stance with the army ? wtf ?
2	he has n't exactly been sitting on his ass http whatthefuckhasobamadonesofar com so long as we have a broken election system , and we have corporate mainstream media outlets as the majority , it 's either him in this next election or darth gop
3	if you want to make serious change , you 're going to need more than <> years to get it done the only problem with that is that people are impatient even if it 's not at the front of his mind for every decision he makes , obama still knows that he ca n't do anything too bad to damage his chances of re elections policies get reduced , arguments get lost , and politics is performed over action but what about in his second term ? he does n't need political support hell , he 's out of there in <> years even more so after his final mid terms whether it 's going to happen or not , the change he promised is the kind of change which has staunch opposition when re election and public support do n't matter , more can be done
1	' separate but equal ' was not just about school segregation , but the whole jim crow political philosophy designed to continually ostracize one class of citizen from the mainstream one of the great lessons we should take away from the civil rights struggle , as thurgood marshal helped to summarize in his historic case , was that ' separate but equal ' is never equal
8	if i had to choose between someone who reluctantly supports a somewhat prejudiced , but practical , solution to the problem or someone who i know has a revolutionary , paradigm changing philosophy , i choose the revolution to me , ron paul 's freedom perspective represents the true equality i know several gay people , including my brother , who feel the same way they do not want institutionalized and legislated second class status per obama but i understand and respect your argument neither one is perfect on this issue i just think ron paul is better ( and right on a bunch of other shit too )
6	you mean like making smug sarcastic replies to perfectly valid posts ?
8	as opposed to a new bill law being vague or stating they have to or something it would have to be worded right or everyone would have their own interpretations
1	start putting non corrupt assholes on the ballot if you have the support what you call corruption is what a bunch of people who support the status quo call good policy there are leftist democrats who , if more numerous would <> nationalize healthcare <> let gays marry <> legalize marijuana <> raise taxes on the rich <> reduce military spending <> increase education funding <> enact progressive environmental policies problem is that a lot of americans do n't want those things they want their hamburger and gas cheap as fuck they do n't want to pay taxes on their huge suburban houses they want to sit in front of the tv while they eat themselves into the hospital and they do n't want to educate any kids to the point where they 'll be looked down on no third party is going to change that the average american voter likes the status quo because they do n't expect much out of life and resent their kids for thinking otherwise if people start wanting things to be different , it will be different right now they do n't want it they definitely do n't want it enough to form a leftist third party spontaneously
1	no , but by your argument of " biologically correct " you pretty much outright state that that 's the basis for marriage which would be really silly ah yay , another ad hominem and then run away ! whee ! i'm so impressed by your rhetoric skills here
8	which is why they should have had more of a separation of church & state we can have freedom of religion , sure , but we also need freedom from religion if it is holding back progress to ensure everyone is treated fairly
2	i think it 's being down voted because of obama clearly has no conviction behind what he 's saying he 's just a politician pandering to a movement that 's gained enough momentum to for him to come out and tag his name onto it without too much risk of backlash why does n't he come out and say " and i believe in gay marraige " ? because he 's simultaneously covering his further right votes he looks lost in the speech cause he does n't want to give too much to either side
2	since being elected , he 's gotten dadt repealed , wo n't defend doma in court , and declared june as lgbt month he may even endorse legalizing same sex marriage ( http www nytimes com <> <> <> us politics <> html ? r <> & pagewanted all ) the white house would not comment on whether mr obama was ready to endorse same sex marriage but one democratic strategist close to the white house , speaking only on the condition of anonymity , said some senior advisers are looking at the tactics of how this might be done if the president chose to do it
8	it 's not an issue of " separate but equal " marriage has a religious definition and connotation to it by removing the word " marriage " , you remove the controversy most people who hate gays ( er hate gay marriage ) trend towards religious , christian , conservatives they are framing marriage as something more than a legally binding relationship letting gay people get married challenges the sanctity of their marriage gay people typically do n't want to get " married " since most churches condemn them anyway they want to enter a legally binding relationship that gives them the same benefits that heterosexual people enjoy with their marriage i'm not saying this is obama 's viewpoint , but the word " marriage " is the crux of the gay marriage argument
1	no no no it was founded on the belief that white male landowners were all created equal , silly
1	exactly , nothing he is saying has any substance to speak of it 's all just fluffy bullshit
2	i think he 'll have mega balls in a <> term with nothing to lose
6	i see a pattern here
2	he has never actually said that he is pro gay marriage to say that gays deserve the same rights as straights dances around the issue he wants to sound pro gay marriage without actually being it
6	prove that marriage is solely a religious construct and tell me which religion in particular owns it
1	bull shit first , note that over a dozen states have explicitly amended their constitution to prohibit not only gay marriage , but also any sort of gay civil union ( source ) ( http en wikipedia org wiki same sex marriage law in the united states by state ) fucking homophobes are n't willing to give gays any legal recognition , even without that " sacred " word " marriage " tied to it secondly , people do n't want their marriage to be " more than a legally binding relationship , " ( emphasis mine ) or else they would n't care so much about what the law says they want a legally binding relationship that people they hate ca n't legally have they want the government to explicitly maintain their status as the " haves " through bigoted legislation if you and your wife want to have a " special relationship , " that 's on you do n't demand that the government enforce its specialness at the expense of other people 's rights
1	no , it would be like rain on your wedding day
6	okay , right off the bat , define " biologically correct sex " because here 's the problem as far as we can tell , there 's nothing " incorrect " about homosexuality the only ones who seem to have a problem with it tend to base this opinion on bronze age mythology of various sorts we live in the <> century welcome to it to further , what do you do with the occasional intersexed person ? or are they just not allowed to marry because their genitals are configured differently on occasion ? are we basing this on chromosomes or genitals possessed for that matter ? because no one has ever had it demanded of them that they expose their genitals or chromosomes just to be sure in these cases if the person is really male or really female next , yes , they do differ on levels besides their sexual preference mostly in how they are treated by law heterosexuals can create partnerships with people who are of the sex they would like to they can have each other on their taxes , on insurance one partner can help another immigrate to this country heterosexuals can see their partner in the hospital , make health decisions for them should that partner not be able to if a partner dies , a married heterosexual gets the partner 's property without court battle or need of larger legal documentation in a heterosexual relationship if one partner dies while in the army their spouse gets supported all of this is denied homosexual couples , and for no good , intellectually honest reason marriage is a legal contract there may be religious connotation , but by that argument atheists could n't marry either we do n't need to see what genitals people possess to sign a legal contract of any other sort , and i really do n't see why we need to the government has a responsibility to protect us from gay marriage ? excuse me ? exactly what horrors is gay marriage going to unleash ? or is this just going to break into the usual slippery slope fallacy right off the bat ? homosexuals vote , pay taxes , pay for some of the privileges enjoyed by married heterosexual couples they not only serve in our military but had to fight for the right to do so it 's just as much their country as it is yours you should treat them like it
1	oh look , another person that has an opinion , and when someone else shares their differing opinion , they insult the intelligence of that person note that i did n't stoop to calling your opinions " stupid " i understand that you have your own beliefs , & i have mine imho , for it to truly be " equal " in every sense of the word , they would have to make it so that any person , gay or straight , could marry whomever they choose and all the same laws and benefits would apply to those unions
1	r politics is no place for irony !
4	agreed , he did more for the environment than clinton , bush or obama
4	agreed , he did more for the environment than clinton , bush or obama
6	maybe he 's an apiarist ?
4	i think he was trying to be funny
1	cuz the little baby jesus sez so !
5	do n't bother you ca n't change peoples minds you have to let hate , and non science work its way out eventually , through generational change it will history has shown that humans only suppress what they fear for limited amounts of time ( biologically speaking ) eventually , these people and their ideas will die out maybe , you and i would n't be around to see it but , they will eventually with logical progress comes a lack of fear derived from ignorance
4	you people are hilarious athymia , homosexual marriage is patently unequal to heterosexual marriage get over it
4	that 's like saying as a woman i want to be referred to as a man , because i want the same rights as the man lol that 's retarted
8	not even all christians are anti gay here in canada the largest denomination is the united church , which is very gay friendly and was a part of how it became recognised here
6	wow , he repealed a law that should have never existed
1	i think you may be confusing the art of great writing with the art of posting had i begun with " wise up my fellow center right and even far right friends " i would have lost democrats who wo n't listen to anything a republican has to say , and republicans who immediatly disagree with anything you have to say that is contrary to their world view both sides need a kick in the ass
6	would n't it be an utter travesty if the first black president lost re election because he lost the black vote as a result of his support for expanding civil rights to people ?
1	nixon also created the epa ! otherwise , though , he was a douchebag
2	but you do n't understand , this is so totally different because people are n't being discriminated against just because of who they are oh wait they are
2	black man alive when separate but equal existed for blacks black man becomes president black man supports separate but equal for gays sane people shit themselves in disbelief at stupidity of aforementioned black man start making excuses for him so as not to appear racist cycle continues nothing to see here
2	my solution is removing the word marriage from any federal legislation if two consenting adults want to commit to each other its a civil union let churches have the term marriage , there problem fixed , and people cant complain about defacing the institution of marriage
1	or , you know , politics the republicans ca n't say " see he ' s a gay supporting muslim socialist " if he hedges his bet like that
6	he thinks the term label " marriage " should be reserved for hetero couples i do n't know if he thinks that , or if it 's simply a political thing which does n't make it better it may in fact be worse , though i suppose if this is a technique for improving the equality of rights step by step , i guess it 's an approach that is worth trying
4	a small step is better than none at all
6	what are the people shouting that he responds to early in the video ? it sounds like the mumbled interjections from that one guy on blazing saddles
6	is it election season already ?
1	yeah , well kind of a meaningless platitude if you 're still dancing around the same sex marriage thing for fuck 's sake , just say it and get it over with playing the center on this issue is just embarrassing there is no middle ground on rights
1	obama gay couples deserve same rights as all , ( which ai n't much because i just resigned the patriot act bitches ! ! ! ! ! ! )
1	yeah , well kind of a meaningless platitude if you 're still dancing around the same sex marriage thing for fuck 's sake , just say it and get it over with playing the center on this issue is just embarrassing there is no middle ground on rights
6	please tell me we 're not going to fall for his election year lies again ? we 're better than that right reddit ?
6	if a civil unioned couple from another country moved to america , would it be completely unrecognised ? i'm guessing yes , but just wondering are gay couples in the states considered de facto at all ?
2	pandering to the homosexual community to get them to donate to his re election campaign so he can go back to ignoring them in his <> term
6	we all have the same right to get married to the biologically correct sex how is this not equal ?
4	good point another aspect of the amendment was that gay marriages from other states will not be recognized this is a clear violation of the full faith and credit clause but challenging it would be futile
6	why should n't they ? do they not live , eat , and struggle together ? in all technicality they are a partnership i think it would be a good way to encourage people to share living spaces with room mates by giving them some incentives like tax breaks ( since they 're helping to increase housing for others ) and certain other rights maybe there should be a few forms of civil union " permanent " civil unions for people who consider themselves married together and temporary civil unions for people who live together but do not share a romance
6	you need to brush up on your american history do n't you know what 's eparate but equal ' refers to ?
8	this is part of the " full faith and credit " part of the constitution states have been refusing , however , to support these no case has successfully challenged this yet , unfortunately
2	pointing out ( apparently ) ignorant remarks is not being an ' internet tough guy '
6	i certainly did n't miss it
5	exactly obama openly supports gay people and it 's not that obama does n't support gay marriage it 's that he is being careful about what he says it 's sad , but he has to play the political game too still , i 'd rather have someone like obama who 's heart is in the right place bachmann on the other hand says shit like this don t misunderstand i am not here bashing people who are homosexuals , who are lesbians , who are bisexual , who are transgender we need to have profound compassion for people who are dealing with the very real issue of sexual dysfunction in their life and sexual identity disorders senator michele bachmann , on homosexuality as a mental disorder , speaking at edwatch national education conference , november <> , <> source ( http thenewcivilrightsmovement com michele bachmanns top ten anti gay quotes politics <> <> <> <> )
5	i know and they should but people are getting too hung up on obama 's refusal to use the word " marriage "
6	is n't that what civil unions are , which obama says he supports ? it 's when the word " marriage " gets thrown around that things get complicated
3	not necessarily for example , in kentucky , the <> state constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage also bans any union that grants gay couples equivalent rights as a marriage i believe many other states have similar statutes unfortunately this will be a complex issue when we finally decide to address it because marriage has always been one of those things that the federal government let the states handle
6	separate but equal ?
2	in my opinion , obama 's stance against gay marriage is simply one of political expediency if he said he was for gay marriage , he might gain some pro gay marriage voters , but he 'd likely push an even greater number of homophobes to vote against him chances are that if someone is for gay marriage , they 're going to vote for obama regardless of whether he advocates for civil unions or gay marriage , so he does n't have a lot to gain i'm eager to see what his stance becomes after <> , assuming he 's reelected i think when he does n't have to worry about a campaign he will feel much more free to support social justice causes like gay marriage and ending the drug war even though he 's hesitant to endorse gay marriage , though , it 's a relief to hear a president state that his views can evolve , and are n't just based on some abstract principles
1	october <> , you would be downvoted to hell times have certainly changed you guys changed , why ca n't he ? btw , i do n't give a shit so do n't flag me for a fanboy not even american
1	he 's not pro gay marriage he 's pro civil unions he 's against gay marriage
1	thats like saying " women deserve the same rights as men " " but not a penis "
1	thats like saying " women deserve the same rights as men " " but not a penis "
8	okay let 's force churches to marry gays because civil unions are n't good enough , that ought to go well gay people deserve the same civil rights as everybody else but damn it if they are n't the whineyest minority around yes it 's time to vote me down now because i think the world has bigger problems than the perceived differences between civil unions and marriage for <> of the population the oceans are filled with poison , our political parties are waddling towards fascism and the world economy is crumbling , i personally do n't care what you call it when gay dudes hook up
2	i never understood why the media and public went after miss california for her gay marriage stance when obama and many elected officials have the exact same opinion beyond ridiculous
5	i think it was a buge step in the right direction tho i have a feeling he 'll through in the word marriage if once hes reelected so he doesnt have to worry about losing potential voters think we will see a completely different obama in his second term , at least i hope
5	cannot update this enough this was a pitiful , spineless performance by mr obama what makes it worse is that he tried to make jokes out of the fact that he 's too spineless to stick up for gays when it counts , and that makes them angry he was acting like he thought that was cute nice hope and change , guy
3	obama 's position right now is just a political calculation he 'll lose more voters than he will gain if he were to support gay marriage , because most people in favor of gay marriage already support him if he does n't change his stance after <> , then i'm completely on board with you
1	does n't say shit about marriage says " keep working till the law does n't treat committed couples who have been together for decades like they are strangers " why do our modern politicians not have any balls ?
1	straight people have the right to get married to a person they would like to legally protect ( medically , financially , etc ) , where as gay people do not how is that equal ? see what i did there ?
6	care to enlighten us as to why not , cockwart ?
5	i'm not trying to be an ass or anything , man but it 's " being " beeing is n't a word
8	so you know gay people are human , not dogs , right ?
2	you would think america would have learned its lesson about " separate but equal " arrangements
2	because he needs the black vote and the black vote occurs and is controlled by black ministers who oppose gay marriage because it is a sin in their religion obama is selling out one group of democrats and abandoning their principles in order to get a larger group of bloc voters that only cost <> per vote
2	democrats are spineless populist animals that think the other side will like them more and possibly vote for them if they cave on certain issues in reality obama is more conservative about social issues than even someone like nixon who openly supported abortion
5	separate but equal should be an abhorrent concept to americans by now
5	it 's more personal for him ( maybe religious ? ) he thinks the term label " marriage " should be reserved for hetero couples , but the legal rights should be granted to all couples he 's fine with gay couples being couples and doing what they want , but uncomfortable with extending the label there 's a recognition of the humanity and love in such relationships , but still some personal uneasiness it 's semantics with terminology while it 's a good thing to have equal treatment , there is still a good counter argument that restricting the word is a form of inequality and disrespect imo getting equal treatment should be the priority terms will follow civil rights , unless you 're a white straight male , have n't been won easily for anyone
2	what currently stops <> opposite gender people from doing the same ? nothing , other than social stigma
6	sorry for the off topic question , but i was wondering why do you believe homosexuality is a sin ? as a gay atheist i still ca n't figure this one out the only places in the bible were homosexuality is mentioned is leviticus ( which does n't state that it 's a sin , but rather commands believers to murder men who have sex with men ) and considering it also prohibits shellfish , tattooing and mixed fiber clothing it 's probably not accepted by most christians ( fulfillment of mosaic law blah , blah ) the other is paul , which <> is not a divine command , but some dude 's commentary and <> it also states that women are subservient to men and condones slavery do you accept all of paul and or leviticus as being applicable today and if not , why is the part about homosexuality ?
6	i think it 's more likely that obama was pretending to be against marriage equality three years ago , because he thought it would help him win his initial election you never know , though
6	the catholics adopted it as their term in the eighth century , how far back do you wanna go ?
8	also , let 's not forget that , for one reason or another , many african americans and hispanics are strongly democrat but anti gay
1	problem fucking solved once you can actually fucking do that and have it fucking mean the same fucking thing as a fucking marriage and not just a fucking rough approximation in some fucking areas but not fucking others
5	exactly i'm an atheist and hold that two people who so wish should be able to be together regardless neither of us want the other 's belief to influence their institutions as usual , separation of church and state is the right answer
8	i am christian and personally fine with separating the religious ceremony from the legal civil union that way churches can apply whatever limits and customs they want on their own services and the state can manage civil unions in the way they feel is best by the way in canada we have gay marriage and a marriage in a church is legally binding it is possible

1	uh , why the fuck are you abusing me ? i never said he was right , and it seems he may have certainly changed his mind recently
2	it was n't so long ago that women and black people had lesser rights , i do n't see why this country is so slow to give equal rights to everybody , when the country was founded on the belief that everyone is created equal & are guaranteed life liberty & pursuit of happiness
5	it 's okay sorry i lashed out a bit too <> ?
6	feel that god clearly designed the family ( man , woman , and children ) to reflect the triune nature , just as the church reflects the triune nature when we follow this design , we 're reflecting god through our family life does that mean you believe being a single parent is a sin ?
1	okay , when was that ? pretty sure religion and superstition run back pretty damn far
8	you 're not the only one ( http i imgur com qgauz jpg ) who 's frustrated by this
6	so all those who feel disenfranchised because he did n't bring the " hope and change " they thought he would should vote for him again because this time he will ? i know this question sounds trollish but i'm curious as to the reasoning
5	ah , i guess i view ' marriage ' as the religious one , and no one has yet come up with a word for a ' non religious union ' that suits my fancy
1	start i never made marriage and offspring exclusive i am done here i will hash out my opinions with boneheads elsewhere stop
4	no need to be dictator i just think it 's time to end the wars in iraq and afghanistan an opinion shared by the majority of the populace as well but hey , enjoy your democracy , and make sure to vote obama in <> , i'm sure he 'll get them out by <>
6	if certain religious officiants did n't want to participate in same sex marriages , they would n't have to this is the way it already is right ? priests agree to marry people , they 're not required
6	you used to just need two witnesses to get married , no priest , no ceremony , no church required the whole idea that marriage is a particularly religious thing is fairly recent if the catholic church can claim marriage as theirs , how come protestants , jews , hindus and the rest can get married and do n't have to have some lesser form of marriage ?
8	peace
6	it means that being single itself is a sin did mary and joseph have other kids ? were they triune ? did the apostles all get married and have kids ? is the word triune even in the bible ?
1	i do n't think so i think of it more along the lines of , " if you are going to do something , do it god 's way " single parents are awesome , and are deserving of respect
8	of course not i did n't mean to imply that " separate but equal " is truly equal my point is that separate but equal ( or , if you prefer , implicitly unequal ) is better than explicitly unequal if you 're granting someone extra rights , that 's a good thing even if things are n't completely equal yet
5	i was n't being intentionally rude to another person
6	marriage is just a word let the christians have their damn word as long as everyone gets treated the same , have the same rights and benefits , whats the big ' effin deal ?
1	what the fuck is society coming too its going down the drain ( obama is ruining this country
5	that is a solution i 've long thought about it , and yes , it could work i have nothing against it either however , marriage was originally a social cultural practice , not religious at all i 'd rather take back marriage marriage <> life
2	holy shot , who gives a fuck ? with the country falling to shambles economically , once again this dumbfuck debate will come up at the forefront to distract everyone from the important things enough of this horseshit with words it 's a fucking word , get you stupid union and say your married problem fucking solved
1	no they do not
8	alright already we get it beeing gay is okay
2	sure they should have the same rights as everyone else but that does n't include marriage it 's like saying dogs should have human rights an oxymoron
6	same , but different i really do n't understand why he has this stance against gay marriage
1	the best way to kill all of the idiocy is to simply remove all benefits of being married from our laws then who cares who marries who and why the problem is the benefits granted to those who are married and denied to others gays are only a subset of that group , so why should they be treated so damned special ?
2	that 's because he likes to tell you what you want to hear , but could actually give two shits about it all he cares about is his political career well that and turning bush policies up to <>
5	it 's sad really the black community and the religious community are particularly homophobic , and he did n't want to piss either off too much while i agree that his position is sad , i think it has very little to do with the black community he is in no danger of losing the black vote or not motivating extremely high voter turnout in black communities it 's more that he fears losing votes of the white middle class swing voters ( many of whom are religious , yes ) if he goes too far out on the " liberal " branch
6	you do n't think his views have changed in <> <> years ?
5	if i had to guess i would say that this move is his attempt at a baby step and his <> view has n't changed but then again guessing is pretty worthless none the less , sometimes in politics you have to take what you can get at the expense of what you want
5	progressives did n't control any branch
6	are you unaware that dadt is still pentagon policy ?
6	is n't this entire thread about how we ca n't trust what he says ?
2	they had control of the senate long enough to pass a law eliminating the filibuster rule and chose not to
5	sorry he did get some things done he extended the patriot act , extended warrantless wiretapping , increased our presence in afghanistan , appointed goldman sachs lobbyists to oversee financial regulation , and appointed the former president of monsanto to oversee food safety so yeah , democrats are capable of doing something if it pleases their corporate masters
2	ignoring like he did when not pushing for repeal of doma , as he said he would in the <> campaign ignoring them like he did when he did defend doma until it was apparent that the defense would fail ignoring them like he did when he did not , as commander in chief of the armed forces , repeal dadt himself something within his authority
2	i remember vaguely he had more open support towards lgbt laws in the <> then in fear of collateral damage from congress slowed his stanced and in many instances with the dadt failed to support various cases of openly gay men or women applying to serve in the armed forces
1	seriously who down votes this ? their marriage is none of your damn business
5	being overly rude when simple discussion or debate would suffice is unnecessary
4	yes , i do obviously we 're not talking about school segregation here it 's an analogy my point is that if civil unions are given the same legal status as marriages , they 'll be a great step toward equality for gay couples
8	that was sort of my point some folks argue that everyone should have the exact same rights , privileges , etc no matter their gender i think for the most part , but there 's reasons i 'll get arrested if i walk into the women 's locker room women 's rooms also generally have more stalls , and no urinals they 're separate , but considered close enough to equal
1	yup , men 's restrooms are <> cleaner than women 's rooms had a restroom cleaning job for like <> weeks
1	yeah , i remember the <> election fucking depressing but even if <> of kentucky voters are in favor of it , all it takes is one couple that 's against it and wants to put forth the effort to challenge it ( which is no small thing being a test case can be really tough ) they might lose on the state level , but could keep appealing until they get to the supreme court if the supreme court says the amendment is unconstitutional , then there 's nothing anyone in kentucky can do about it this is one thing that people complaining about " activist judges " miss it 's the job of the judicial branch to protect the minority from the majority this has been shown time and again e g brown v board of education , loving v virginia , lawrence v texas each of those cases involved a state law that had been passed by a majority vote of some kind , and in each case the supreme court struck down the law as unconstitutional to protect the rights of the minority it 's not " activist , " it 's just doing their job
5	first , thanks very much for the off topic question , primarly because it did n't consist of , " omfg you are such a bigot ! " you actually seem like you want an honest answer unfortunately , about to head out so the best i can do is sum up and would be more than happy to elaborate further if necessary a lot of this stuff comes down to large cans of worms in and of themselves , so i 'll try my best to be terse " short " answer <> ) old testament law is not gone because it 's in the old testament jesus clearly said he came to " fulfill the law , not abolish it " there is no biblical reason to assume something is invalid simply because of where it is in the bible paul ( like in romans ) clearly affirms that this command is still the case <> ) that does n't mean everything is automatically valid there is a good portion of levitical law etc that is not applicable , for example , due to being in reference to sacrifice the temple etc ie you ca n't come to pray unless you slaughter a dove you do n't need to be " ceremonially clean " , which was only temporary to begin with , because jesus has paid that sacrifice as far as ot interpretation among christians goes , this all too often comes down to cherry picking what they feel is appropriate , which is very unfortunate i think that while the ot is looked at is strict , the nt is actually more strict in a lot of ways ie instead of retribution , give your enemies better than they deserve ultimately , while i think because god said so is fine , i think the biggest thing people ( christians included ) tend to miss on a lot of things is why things are a sin god 's laws are not arbitrary he commands us to be like him ie he tells us to tell the truth because he tells the truth we are commanded to forgive because he forgives if you go a bit deeper , the most important command is to love god and when you reflect one of god 's qualities , you are reflecting love for him both through obedience and imitation so , if i had to guess ( and that 's exactly what this is ) why i feel god wrote that homosexuality is wrong , i would say this i feel that god clearly designed the family ( man , woman , and children ) to reflect the triune nature , just as the church reflects the triune nature when we follow this design , we 're reflecting god through our family life hope that helps somewhat to explain how i feel on the matter unfortunately , the most honest answer for most christians would be , " because my church says so " please let me know if anything there is unclear or could be further elaborated !
4	did n't mean to point the finger at you in fact i assumed you disagree with " separate but equal " and i upvoted you here , i 'll upvote you again it seems he may have certainly changed his mind recently it 's hard to tell
5	that 's a different issue even when the democrats had <> senators there were never <> " in support of breaking a filibuster " so that 's not the same standard the question is what the democrats could have done , not what they did do of course they did n't support changing the rules , otherwise they would have done so
2	i could not disagree more it has everything to do with cowardice and bravery you 're so scared that " the evil republicans " will get elected that you 're willing to allow the just as corrupt democrats fuck us over time and time again neither party is worth the air they breathe and the only way we can break this cycle is to revolt or vote them out i'm on board for either one so long as we get these corrupt assholes out of power
2	yeah , because democrats need to be weary of pissing off the republican base , else they may not get their votes
6	it 's not like either of the <> parties ' candidates that will run & win would openly state " one of my first goals in office is to pass gay marriage " they 'd definitely be at a disadvantage then personally if one did , & i agreed with or at least accepted their other views , i 'd definitely vote for that candidate , but it simply wo n't happen i would not vote for someone who openly stated they 'd do everything they could to make sure it never passed
6	your original post said he has never actually said that he is pro gay marriage my reply showed that that is factually incorrect your most recent post is tangential to mine
1	american politics are so fucked
1	created equal does n't mean shit about how you 're treated after birth , just ask any republican
5	if you were to actually read the rest of the document , you 'd see that 's precisely what they meant i know that makes it more difficult to be smug in reply
2	because parties a and b have mutually agreed that parties c , d , e , f , g , etc have completely unacceptable opinions and must be censored if you vote for them , you get called a communist nazi pig
1	the more recent purposes of government involvement you outline can easily be handled through a contract between any two individuals , same sex , or not that 's essentially what marriage licenses are , a contract between two people validated by the state , which gives them access to certain rights privileges benefits , and currently most states discriminate who can and cannot enter into such contracts call it whatever you want , marriage , civil unions , partnerships , i do n't care , the crucial part is that the laws which deal with these contracts ( currently referred to as marriage laws ) should not discriminate ron paul 's argument is a red herring , not far from the whole " redefining " argument you sometimes seen , which misses the point that whether or not states wish to have marriage laws , they must provide equal protection under the law to preach that states should be able to discriminate , and further more support an act which has the federal government discriminating in that matter as well , is not advocating marriage equality
4	they also deserve a president who will deliver these rights
8	separate but equal is n't great , but it 's better than separate but unequal two of my best friends are a gay couple with two kids they 're married , but that does n't have any legal status on the federal level as a result , they get fucked with their taxes every year ( one has a high paying job and the other does n't earn anything , so they would really benefit from being able to file jointly ) , and if one of them were to die the other could get fucked with inheritance taxes ( from which married couples are exempt )
2	it was sarcasm and in jest there 's no point being an " internet tough guy "
1	yea what a douche
1	what 's really fucked is that the " religious nutjobs " ( and the secular nutjobs for that matter ) just plug their ears , close their eyes , and sing " lalalalalala " whenever they 're reminded that he is pushing murderous neocon bush <> <> policies that are killing innocent people every day because obviously that 's not nearly as important as gay marriage !
4	things like this tend to happen in steps , or not at all even slavery ended in this country in several steps social reform does n't happen overnight a small step is made , and once people see the world has n't ended , another step is made
1	that 's true there 's a lot times when personal belief is separated from political stances for example , abortion there 's a lot of people who would n't get an abortion themselves , but also would n't stop someone else from doing it i mean , personally , i have no intention of tattooing my face , but i do n't think that means i 'd favor a law making that illegal just because people are opposed to things on a personal level does n't mean they have to be opposed to them on a political level
1	pretty much exactly what i thought actual legal equality is the most tangible and important thing on this topic , which is what he 's pursuing fucking with the semantics is just pandering designed to artificially soften his stance to the opposition and make it seem like he is " preserving the sacred religious institution of marriage , " which is a marked concern of hillbillies and retards all throughout the country a very " left moderate " move that should come as no surprise
6	indeed i was n't thinking about that when i posted others have replied with other political arguments how about this he makes it look personal for him
6	i mean election time is coming up look for more sound bites !
5	religious term ? not really , but it 's a big part of some religions more of a human cultural social thing i did a little reading on wikipedia 's marriage article just now ( good read ) , it does n't look like it began as a religious thing since then , religions , particularly the abrahamic trio , have claimed it as their own and monopolized it for a while so , it does look like it is interestingly , early christians did n't consider it religious at all imo marriage is the term we call it as a society calling everything on the government 's end civil unions instead of marriage just muddies everything i say we take back marriage marriage <> life
6	did n't we already know this ? now , has he actually done anything about it ?
1	haha , bullshit obama wo n't do a fucking thing
1	i tend to lean right of center , and would n't vote for a democrat at gunpoint however , as america recognizes one citizen , it must recognize all if gays want to marry , fine , i could care less make sure though that if you give them all the laws of marriage , you give them all the laws of divorce the country is dying economically and this <> election is about jobs and the economy everything else , including the social agenda which includes gay marriage , abortion and a host of other causes needs to be put on the back burner for a period of <> years why ? because if it keeps going the way it 's going , you wo n't have a country social programs wo n't matter at that point wise up my fellow center right and even far right friends , the house of cards is falling and you are fighting all the way down
2	words are cheap and in this case , worthless
1	" we 're gonna keep fighting ! " he 's going to fight himself ?
2	the government should have no business in marriage , or sex there should be no government benefits based on who you decide to live with , or sleep with it 's so asinine that i do n't even see the argument get rid of tax breaks and benefits for married couples of any sex leave unions up to the people being joined and whoever they choose to perform whatever ceremony they choose to do
6	a few years later gay marriages will become legal in all of us then after some time , you guys will have a gay president then religious constitutions will start paying taxes later on , after some similar cycles you will eventually have an atheist president , who will free cannabis use but that wo n't change the fact it is the corporations who rule the country , not people also , not specifically us many country has that pattern
1	curious and curiouser obama is starting to sound like it 's <> again wonder why that may be the " vote for change " thing probably wo n't work this time around considering that democrats controlled all three branches of government and still could n't get shit done
4	he dances a fine dance
6	christianity is n't the only religion with " marriage " and not all of them are anti gay christians dont own that word , why give it to them ?
3	the sky is falling ! the sky is falling !
1	damn you , poe 's law , damn you !
2	i thought they had that whole crash thing to worry about it is n't like he stopped defending the doma , or ended dadt , or even like he expanded hate crime legislation nah nothing of the sort
4	glad to see you 're using your right to say asinine nonsense
1	what the fuck is society coming too ? its motherfucking senses
6	if they 've regressed , we should take that into account and not reelect him how conservative will he be in four more years ?
1	good thing civil rights are no longer " important things " there are a lot of laws guaranteeing rights for " married " couples not civil unions as kanst said , if you change the laws to make all legal references to civil unions , that is fine until then , it is much more than " a fucking word "
1	no , i am saying obama should n't be revered as a gay rights advocate
1	" biologically correct sex " , as i used it in that context means that the two people engaging in such sex can produce offspring what is incorrect about homosexuality ? seriously ? i am not going to go into a rigorous debate with you on this matter because it ultimately comes down to peripheral beliefs that we each hold that most likely differ there has been so much cultural deconditioning to this mental disorder it is unreal my core opinion is that it is unhealthy and unnatural for men to buttfuck other men and women to poke and prod with other women it is unhealthy hedonism in disguise of legitimate function need i bring up statistics of drug abuse and sexual disease within these communities ? what about the lisp gay men use ? or the clothing styles hair styles of lesbians ? of course it is not <> did you get what you want out of me ? now downvote as you see fit , but you only reveal how much group think is really going on here on reddit i have the right to this opinion as much as you do to yours so go " experiment " with your body parts if you like but i know where and how to use mine , thank you
1	the short of it libya has oil lots of it therefore , developed countries will do whateverthefuck it takes to make sure that world markets continue to have access to it
2	the root of the debate is homophobia though opponents of gay marriage use the " sanctity of marriage " as their only argument though they ca n't say " gay people should n't be able to get married because i hate fags and do n't want to legitimize their relationship " they have to act like gay marriage is a personal attack on them and their institutions in comes religion and suddenly marriage is this super religious experience ( which just happens to have some legal social repercussions , but that is n't important right now ) and you 're violating the bible by letting it be between two men or two women
6	i think his views have changed within <> to <> years
4	many people do n't trust him because he is the " nigger president " in this case he said what he was going to do he explained his reasoning he followed through on what he said he was going to do despite that the op hates him and the only rational explanation is racism because obama 's reasoning is solid , consistent and his approach is smart
5	officially , yes unofficially , it 's done in october ( two months before the repeal 's passage ) , the policy was changed so that dadt discharges required the authorization of the person 's service secretary , the military 's general counsel , and the secretary of defense 's personnel chief in other words , it was effectively ended there has been exactly one dadt discharge ( http www military com news article first servicemember fired under dadt since october html ) since , and that was because the person involved wanted to be discharged still think obama was " too little too late ? "
4	thank you for explaining a bit more and yes , i can see this , now but , ultimately , he succeeded in having " dadt " repealed what a lot of people do n't realize is that in politics you have to concede and regroup , and or retreat when needed if you just fight , fight , fight for the just at all times you wo n't be a politician for long you will not be reelected and then you ca n't try to work towards the overall goal i am not implying anything about obama but , a lot of people want their constitutes to just fight at all times for the best , most just position at all times and you just ca n't honor does not always win the ultimate battle strategy and good judgment with a lot of luck does
4	thanks for the info it 's been a couple years since i really looked into the subject so i was n't sure
8	so basically you 're saying that he ignored the issue of gay rights until he did n't anymore , and that he ignored it by taking a different ( and more difficult to reverse ) path to reach the same end we were looking for ? do n't get me wrong , i wish obama were more pushy on this and a whole bunch of other issues but i think it 's pretty disingenuous to say that he 's ignoring an issue or group of people because we 're not seeing results fast enough
2	downvote those whom you disagree with in the case of elections , vote for those whose interests you agree with the most i always make a pro con list , and then see whether the person in question cries a lot ( lookin ' at you , boehner )
2	find the person who aligns most closely with your views estimate his or her chance of winning i e how many of your fellow citizens you think agree with your choice if it is not likely that your candidate will win , compromise and go with the next best choice the time to put more aggressive candidates on the ballot is at nomination and primary time the usa 's election structure pretty much ensures a two party system , so the best hope for changing the political spectrum is to determine if a more liberal candidate could be viable in the main election and if so , supporting that person for nomination and in the primaries obvious , but maybe not considering the hand wringing that goes on deciding whether to vote third party short answer , no

6	but what about party iota , the all powerful party spread across the world manipulating everyone ?
8	being single is not a sin in fact the bible even goes so far as to say that it 's better for a man to be single and devote himself entirely to god however , if he is lustful , it 's better to marry than give way to sin easy example there roman catholic priests would be much better if they were allowed to marry mary and joseph definitely had other kids iirc he had four named brothers , and " several " sisters mary obviously did n't stay a virgin , hehe i'm not sure about the marital status of the apostles off the top of my head the word triune , trinity , etc does not exist in the bible it clearly describes the relationship of the father , son , and holy spirit , and that the three are one so while we 've invented the words for the " holy trinity " , we certainly did n't invent it each social construct described in the bible describes mirrors this setup father wife kids for the family jesus preacher congregation in a church god , the ruler , and the people for government , etc
2	exactly , as much as it sucks , it is true that 's part of why the gop fights tooth and nail to reduce voters and get people to feel hopeless and not vote or vote for a third party that cannot win traditionally , the more voters there are , the worse the gop does they have their staunch set of supporters and do n't have to rely on swing voters nearly as much , and when the swing voters come out to vote , they more often vote demo man , i would love to get a social libertarian in office , or even a progressive it would be nice to shift the national dialogue a bit back to center and make it okay to talk about balancing the middle class so it can stand against the oligarch
4	then you 'd think they 'd pass it fast so that all the gay people would be distracted planning weddings and all the people objecting it would be too busy sharpening pitchforks and making protest signs that they 'd have their <> year old hold during a picket of said weddings lol
4	oh , my bad yeah , i saw the part that stated " all men are created equal " i guess they meant " all white men who own property are created equal " pretty confusing , glad you could enlighten me
8	well , i'm sure he does n't want to go out of his way to offend the religious nutjobs who 'd definitely never vote for him again if he came right out and said " i 'd totally pass a law stating gays can marry wherever they want if it were up to me " not saying he 's all for it , but politicians try to not offend anyone who could give them an advantage , say , in a coming election
8	from the same article " in a <> questionnaire filled out for a chicago gay and lesbian newspaper , then called outlines , obama came out clearly in favor of same sex marriage , which he has opposed on the public record throughout his short career in national politics " i think his more recent statements as the president of the united states hold more weight than a <> questionnaire
2	precisely he is skirting the issue they " have the same rights " but he wo n't support gay marraige hmmmmmm not quite an oxymoron , like <> , but certainly some sort of verbal tap dancing to appease all with nothing
6	why not party c ?
6	then sometimes people for vote for party a , just to keep party b out when they really align better with party c , but understand that party c does n't have a chance to win is it better to vote your own interests , or vote against those whose interests offend you the most ?
6	you mean right before he took on dadt and doma ?
6	is there a chance he 'd actually do something though , or even is capable of doing something ? maybe this is just more publicity for the election
4	funny , that in our system these topics only come down the pipeline when elections are around the corner
2	the same rights except marriage obama pointedly does not support the new york bill , and does not support gay marriage
6	out of curiosity , what rights do homosexuals not have ? just not the ability to conceive ? sorry , but that 's not something we can vote on
2	watch this obama guy , next thing you know he 'll be saying that blacks deserve the same rights as all
2	marriage is a religious institution if i were gay and they did n't want me to be married , i could give two shits about their " institution " the rights are the only thing that matters
2	if gay people want to be miserable like heterosexual couples , then let them do it
8	ron paul hit the nail on the head in the gop debate that we should n't have gay rights , or women 's rights , or black 's rights , etc , but only human rights rights are n't attributed to one group of people or another , but are inherent to all just another example of how basic adherence to the constitution can solve so many of our problems
6	did n't he say that last time ?
2	there 's a goddamn search function people come on
1	heh , fuck that shit let china protect their own border
6	the north korean government should manufacture heroin for its people <> it would allow them to mask their problems " look at this magical medicine our dear leader has created ! <> it would make the populous complacent " why not shoot up instead of argue ? " and if they do argue , they can just pull their source enjoy your withdraws , lol hell , this dictator thing is easy
6	i'm surprised the north koreans did n't think of this earlier why not become a narco state ? the pyongyang regime already runs the country like a giant slave labour camp , so why not operate at least one cash industry , regardless of the morality ?
6	seems smart the dprk is rational a crazy , batshit , unscrupulous kind of rational but rational nonetheless
6	after reading this article and that one about russian krokodil , i 've come to a startling conclusion ( to paraphrase jurassic park ) because the history of evolution is that drugs escape all barriers drugs break free drugs expand to new territories painfully , perhaps even dangerously but drugs find a way
6	twenty years ago , yanji had only <> registered drug addicts last year , the city registered almost <> , <> drug addicts odd i was under the impression that using abusing drugs in china was a mandatory death sentence have they relaxed their rules ?
6	meth is pretty hardcore you have to be rather serious about your drug use to do something that can be cooked in a tub man , why does this meth taste like soap ?
4	i'm here with blorktronics north korea is starving again this time china does n't want to send aid besides the fact that former aid was mismanaged , loans were n't payed back and kim jong il is sending insane threats good reason may be support of dprk for organized crime in china you wont hear about this on reddit , but afaik much more repression in the country is aimed at crime syndicates than human rights activist imo , in the long run china may prefer more american military near its land border look at afghanistan china is much better off with semi failed state right now and american presence than with civil war <> <> and total chaos
6	because it would royally piss off china , north korea 's last remaining ' ally ' and supplier of vital resources such as oil it would not be a wise move
3	that is strangely and frighteningly appropriate
8	trafficking is a death sentence for sure that 's what got that australian man sentenced to death a year or two back not sure about using though , but that may depend on how much of the drug they had on them when they were caught
5	drugs are nothing but what human nature makes them so you 'd be more correct in saying human nature finds a way
2	<> , <> euro is small for a corporate ceo , maybe but for the average farmer , <> , <> income is hog heaven we 're discussing the idea of subsidization , but you 've just pointed out an implementation detail hair splitting as if you could have the former without the later eu citizens lose , because they have to pay for the subsidies with their taxes , and in stores for higher import prices , because of eu protectionism the infamous " banana wars " are a case in point , during which the eu tried to force inferior fruit on its consumers by keeping latin american bananas out of the market with quotas and tariffs
2	agreed the free trade zone did everything that european countries needed the euro removed the minuscule transaction costs of dealing in several currencies and the associated risk of volatility , but it came with a rigidity and an agenda for economic homogeneity that was never going to be realised if you build a car mostly from racing car parts , but include odd bits such as the wheels from a farm cart , the result is not going to be harmonious to hope that a wooden wheel will magically transform itself into one of mr michellin 's more delicate creations whilst on the track was never more than a silly dream
3	a more likely explanation with the unfortunate consequence that today europe is facing the results of a eurozone folie a dix sept
1	i disagree with the generalization , especially economically , but i do see your point but they gave up that option when then took up the euro i think though that we also have to look at their military spending as long as they are shoveling a huge portion of their rather meager gdp into a military that they believe is capable of defending them against their oft provoked neighbors , i think they will have a hard time paying their bills i just noticed those reposts fuck android fuck it all to hell
6	wwi bulgaria in pact with germany war lost wwii bulgaria in pact with germany ( axis ) war lost <> bulgaria sign the warsaw pact established at the soviet union s initiative <> pact disestablished <> bulgaria joined the eu ? ? ?
4	so the greek guy in the article is a shop owner ( bike repair ) just out of curiosity it would be interesting to ask him how many jobs he did last month and how many bills he actually rung
4	i love articles like that especially since they are so wrong , but then again it 's der spiegel , what did i expect spanish and greek youths are protesting ( for obvious reasons , although i think they both are acting entitled ) that 's hardly millions across europe
6	lol who would have ever imagined a big conglomerate of lazy , ungrateful , effeminate , hopelessly government dependent , business hating socialist parasites would eventually have financial problems ? all we need to do is get a wal mart over there and then we will own your worthless asses
8	the younger generations do n't remember a war torn europe creating disincentives for another large scale conflict on the continent is the single greatest achievement of the economic union
6	oh no ! we do n't want to work with a system that can potentially bring a huge amount of wealth and peace to us so instead we are going to reminisce about the good ole ' days when we were our own countries ! we totally lived peacefully , and thrived economically then its definitely not our own inability to get along with people who come from countries we hate for reasons we no longer understand
6	a lot would be achieved if politicians were n't serving the business lobbyists and special interests , but the people instead i always wonder if this is actually true are businesses getting rich by causing allowing crises like these to happen ? or are the youth just looking for someone to blame ?
6	you mean the easy mechanism the obvious mechanism is for them to cut their public sector and increase emigration to other parts of the union i think that the currency devaluation method is the easy way out
6	why was the euro ever introduced in the first place ? there was no lack of warnings by competent economists about its dangers ( http www nytimes com <> <> <> magazine <> t html ) we basically expanded our economic terrority no eurozone less exports germany has been consistently among the leading exporters on the world market since at least the <> so it obviously does n't take the euro we do n't get more out of the eu than we pay into it but we get more out of the countries , corporations and citizens of the eu than we pay into the eu see above germany did very well with the mark in the past if we lose that we would lose millions of jobs the euro has done nothing to stop the loss of jobs that has been going on in germany since the reunification nor the stagnation of real wages and salaries the value of the d mark would skyrocket , therefore exports would get more expensive and the price of your imports would fall accordingly has n't germany been much criticized in the current eurozone crisis for its export biased balance of trade , and to told buy more from other countries ?
6	in real value germany paid more but not nominally as real value represents the actual worth of money more accurately , does this mean you concede the point ? it deserves pointing out that the victors of versailles demanded payment of those <> billion in goldmarks ( http en wikipedia org wiki german gold mark ) , a currency based on gold and silver <> goldmark <> <> grammes of gold , or <> <> grammes of silver besides , german payments to the eu have continued since <> i would also like to ask what source your updated figures are from ?
2	woops
1	yes it has , because subsidies based on crop acreage and number of stock will inevitably benefit larger farms more than smaller ones we 're discussing the idea of subsidization , but you 've just pointed out an implementation detail furthermore , does n't the quote from the wikileak actually support the opposite ? <> , <> euro is small that aside , i reiterate local industrial agriculture is better than no agriculture at all according to a reliable source who wanted to remain anonymous , there is allegedly a compromise on the ceiling of individual farmers earning more than <> , <> euro where the beneficiary stands to lose <> percent of the subsidies while those earning lower amounts will lose far less that is n't ideal , but if you 're proposing that the eu remove subsidies as a result , i vehemently disagree baby and bathwater , perfect is the enemy of good , etc
5	too late walmart failed in germany because the appeal of buying a t shirt that is <> cheaper that has to be replaced <> sooner did n't appeal to the locals
4	lol , americans downvoting because they know they are in <> worse financial status than the eu
4	the eu exists because , not so long ago , we were going at war with each over every over decade and , after the last one , people thought it would be a good idea to stop doing this
6	it would still be way more democratic than the usa
5	the article is alarmist and misleading they had a protest in munich to support the psanish protests this weekend there were <> people there it was pathetic
2	so , you believe that germany invests in the european union out of sympathy for the poorer countries ?
6	so then germany the alberta of the eu it all makes sense now !
4	thanks i agree with you as above , and was also surprised by <> as ever , this was a political grand project , with its goal being to be grand , a flagship , but a flagship without a fleet or sailing directions one sees similar duke of york nonsense in eu policy on the environment ( biofuels directive ) and the social legislation that it has enacted apparently specifically to raise costs ( the grand old duke of york , he had ten thousand men he marched them up to the top of the hill and he marched them down again and when they were up they were up and when they were down they were down and when they were only half way up they were neither up nor down old english folk tune on the futility of ill considered initiatives )
8	i do n't think this is proof that the world is overpopulated , this is just a severe economic downturn in the global economy it 's also the result of a more globalized world where many jobs can be done more cheaply elsewhere having said that , i do think the world is overpopulated , and would like to see the population a lot lower than it currently is
2	it 's not the normal networking that bothers me , it 's the opening of a position in public contest for a specific person kind of networking in socialist portugal you open the positions , if well connected i am not that kind of person i am a regular voter , i am an active member of one of the top <> parties in portugal but that does not stops me from seeing and writing about what 's wrong i believe in honest hard work and i see many talents being wasted because lack of connections why should the son of our ex president get a top executive job in one of our largest corp at <> y o fresh out of the university ? it was hes first job ! i'm sure there were people much more experienced and qualified that were left behind because they did n't had the right connections edit typo
8	or <> sigh and accept
2	truly , why not ? might as well because this idea is as absurd as the idea that there are not enough jobs to go around if the elite who horde money actually invest it in growing the economy and creating jobs , we would n't have the choice between a shit job or no job
1	what all the voting i did was n't democratic ? you voted for a parliament that has very few powers , but high salaries , and quite some disreputable members i'm damn certain that the eu has problems , but frankly its better than sheer bitter competition wait until greece has to restructure its debt , and other eurozone members will have to cover the dozens of billions that have vanished out of their banks balance sheets than you are going to see some sheer bitter competition ! personally i 'd like some form of federalised continental nation good luck trying to create policies that will answer the needs of <> very diverse and heterogeneous nations one size fits all ? the euro monetary policy certainly does not furthermore i'm utterly aghast at the mess that greece is in , and now imagine the politicians responsible for this mess would n't need to borrow in the bond market , but had instead the power to transfer the tax money of other nations to themselves in your pan european " federalised continental nation "
2	yeah , thats how i got all my jobs statist morons
4	in munich we are actually doing just fine , thank you
2	absolutely , but the greeks themselves are just being whining little turds ( sorry , but it 's true ) they claim that they did n't do anything wrong but the politicians did it ! and now they do n't really want to fix the problems other people ( in their eyes ) created , but they just want to go on strikes and protest all year round like that 's going to fix their country it 's frustrating for me as a pro eu supporter to see how a country that has fucked up is almost gleefully trying to get itself either expelled from the euro ( and that would be a bad thing considering there are other nonimees that might have to get booted after ) or trying to go bankrupt ( and how that 'd help the greek is beyond me ) i'm not saying we should support hem indefinitely , but come on guys , yeah you got screwed , but this is n't helping the rest of us that are trying to help you win over the doubters
1	you 're absolutely right and , iirc , germany has a fairly robust federal system to deal with just that issue the larger the scale of a political institution , the more narrowly its powers must be defined but the eu does n't seem to understand this , and acts like it 's governing a municipality , a region , a nation state , and an international organization all at once that does n't work , and leads to the exact sort of problems that are now occurring
6	what about this for an idea that will probably get shot down in flames we keep the euro for international trade , business , finance and so on but allow individual nations to issue their own supplementary currencies for personal use ? they could be backed against gold cheese wine reserves ( or the euro itself ! ) and might allow for two things <> the prospect of not having mountains of debt being defaulted on by the wholesale abandonment of the euro along with all the messy associated consequences of that <> an organic decoupling of the real economy from the domain of speculative finance and stampeding herds of investors
4	thanks for setting me straight i had no idea the euro was introduced in <> , nor did i realise that those bundesbank sourced statistics you quote are relevant to the cost of small ticket items the common individual spends his her disposable income on prices of which rose consistently across the eurozone the whole goddamn point of the euro was to provide a unified command and control mechanism intended to provide economic stability and normalise costs across the zone raising prices in poor countries to the level of the richer nations while hoping and relying upon some mythical process through which the italians would get organised , the spanish productive , the greeks start paying taxes , the irish to stop gerrymandering and the germans to develop a sense of humour i wo n't mention the french and so on quite naturally , if i give you my car keys and you are already drunk , following which i get in the car with you and encourage you to put your foot on the accelerator before even a single driving lesson ok , screw the analogy and have spent <> of the last <> years in default then i certainly bear a significant measure of responsibility the crash that probabilistically occurs oliversparrow provides an excellent macroeconomic summary
2	so tell me why the number of family owned farms , who are allegedly to benefit from all this money , has been dropping for years , whereas industrial agriculture has been on the rise ? indeed , that is a problem , because industrial agriculture is high intensity and thus much more fragile to shocks ( e g oil price ) however , that has nothing to do with the idea of subsidization , but rather its implementation that said , local industrial agriculture is better than no agriculture at all i will also point out that you can lead a horse to water , but cannot make it drink there is a general attitude among the young generation that food production work is low prestige , even though it 's the foundation of civilization , so few want anything to do with it the average income of your farmers has not been improved that much either without subsidies they may have been the opposite of improved more data needed to support small eu farmers would be better without subsidies and food prices in the eu were not spared from the effects of the <> <> world food price crisis , were they ? first , eu may not produce enough food for its population , so it 'd still be vulnerable to external prices even if its local food were no longer part of those markets but the vulnerability is reduced second , there 's nothing wrong with price fluctuations so long as there is n't an emergency once there is an emergency , you can legislate all food production be rerouted to local use
2	to repeat it what nation within that union was supposed to have been a threat to peace ? all germany was see , and there 's your misunderstanding the coal steel union was n't founded to prevent any imminent war , but to make it forever impossible the us got a federal army ( which is unthinkable in europe ) as europe has a highly integrated and interdependent steel industry , both for exactly the same reason
1	what all the voting i did was n't democratic ? granted i got some right wing nationalists representing my country for my efforts , but i disagree there i'm damn certain that the eu has problems , but frankly its better than sheer bitter competition and if we can grow further together , personally i 'd like some form of federalised continental nation to grow out of it , then i think it would be good furthermore i'm utterly aghast at the mess that greece is in , i know that equally while britain is avoiding helping them benefits us i'm appalled that we 're not
4	krugman is right , we are entering a new economic dark ages if there are thousands of jobs vacancies and only a handful of people looking for a job , then you can blame the unemployed for not attaining the right skills to fill in one of those vacancies when there are millions of unemployed and no job vacancies , then you blame the government and monetary authorities this is not some weird fringe economic theory it 's the mainstream analysis of the great depression on which both keynes and milton friedman built their whole careers ask any competent macroeconomist and he 'll give you this correct diagnosis
1	i do n't think you understand anything about this the young generation does n't ask to dismantle the european union ( like their parents ) , but ask instead what is their future while their countries are on the brink of defaulting and they will have to pay the bill ( for their parents and grand parents mistakes ) now shut the fuck up
2	yeah germany would be so much worse off without having to support all of the countries that are failing
1	there 's a huge fucking difference between the cuddly , pan european , post nationalist desire for a supranational entity built on commonalities of shared histories , cohesive diversity and open borders and the fundamentally opaque , antidemocratic and parasitical , absurdly inefficient bureaucracy that passes the laws i believe the growing protests will ultimately result in close scrutiny to fundamental structural issues that have been swept under the rug and ignored by most except for marginalised fringe movements for far too long some of these issues are <> the euro was designed to simplify trade and unify productivity has so far ended up in making everything more expensive for consumers fueling rampant speculative bubbles in banking and property due to cheap credit and lack of breaks once provided by currency exchanges letting bankingscum seduced greek governments ( along with the irish , spanish and well , all of them to a certain degree ) get away with economic foolishness while believing themselves safe in the insecure knowledge that the safety net of the ecb would always have their backs <> the lack of transparent democratic process inherent in the bastard ( technical use , not pejorative ) institutions the political project of the eu has begotten i e length of us constitution <> pages of inspiring prose length of eu constitution <> pages of legalese , plus numerous appendices and fuck all public debate on the contents <> demographic challenges basically , old europe has n't been having enough babies the traditional population pyramid is becoming inexorably inverted leaving us with only a decade or two before there are more people over <> than under it que massive pension shortfalls and the realisation that no social welfare system in its currently systematized operation can survived when more people are drawing from it than are contributing from it so the original plan was to unify currencies , standardise goods and services across the union , increase migration as well as filling the chronic labour shortage by importing workers from the wider world but unfuckingfortunately , it turns out that there may be one or two problems developing and the feedback loops are resulting in poverty rooted intercultural , interclass discord and ghettoisation , erosion of european national identities the far right have always profited from tidal upswells in poverty despair and if we do n't tackle the very real problem cultural , economic and political in a mature and responsible way , they 'll goosestep with glee and may soon even start to win national elections then we 'll all really be fucked but , at least the trains might run on time again tl dr the protesters have got a point and their leaders should listen to the rationality of their concerns lest we end up tearing europe apart live together , die alone and all that
6	are you sure ? i coulda sworn i heard some kind of rumbling from upstairs or maybe that was just my psychotic drunk neighbor
8	we do n't want to work with a system that can potentially bring a huge amount of wealth to politicians , bureaucrats , and corporations , not to the people we totally lived peacefully , the eu 's attempt at peacekeeping in ex yugoslavia proved that they cannot get anything done without the us the current campaign in libya confirms this it was the bi polar power status of the cold war that brought peace to europe , not the eu its definitely not our own inability to get along with people who come from countries we hate for reasons we no longer understand painting the unemployed and excluded as right wing morons only shows that no rational arguments are left for the continued existence of this european union as one commentator put it aptly " the eu is a <> answer to the problems of the <> " in terms of preparing europe for the challenges of the future , it is a total failure proof compare the presence with the goals stated in the lisbon strategy ( http en wikipedia org wiki lisbon agenda ) ' its aim was to make the eu " the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion " , by <> ' what a sorry joke
6	or perhaps it 's be something more like this oh no ! we do n't want to be shoehorned into a uniform bureaucratic system that encourages conflict and creates stagnation by attempting to create one size fits all policies for countries that are vastly different culturally and economically ! we know from history what kind of bad things can happen from creating centralized , unaccountable authority in europe
6	sure , at the same time the implementation is highly anti democratic the european executive power is embodied by the european commission and the european council they basically appoint each other with the help of some corrupt politicians of the particular countries the parliament is the only body under direct democratic influence and all it can do is veto the entire body of appointees while having legislative power it cannot even do any legislative initiative without the commission in short , too much power for an unchecked body of politicians when was that ever a recipe for success this usually runs well initially and quickly turns into corruption driven plutocratic regimes
2	rubbish there are advantages to the us system things i miss that said there are great things abluot europe a hybrid would better than either by itself
2	spending fully half of its budget ( more in the past ) on the subsidizing of agriculture for decades ! this is a problem because ? air , water , food , shelter , security are necessities , in that order if you 're not protecting your local food production , you 're a bloody idiot ( to put it mildly )
2	ironically , it 's the very strength of the euro that 's causing problems for greece greece should never have been allowed into the euro to start with they basically lied about their finances to get in , and as a result they 're stuck with a relatively strong currency at a time when they should be devaluing
4	right on i would like a unified europe but not anything akin to what the eu is delivering it needs to be taken out of the hands of corrupt bureaucrats and lifetime politicians and put into the hands of visionary leaders , but the world has a massive short fall of non media preening political leadership
4	for laughing out loud , drrichardcranium keeps pumping out these articles of how the sky is going to fall in the eu , but miraculously it really has n't
2	to repeat it what nation within that union was supposed to have been a threat to peace ? germany was occupied , divided , overrun with refugees , paying reparations , and bombed to pieces it neither could , nor wanted to , wage war again for the foreseeable future the danger of war after <> came from the soviet union and the warsaw pact organization , against which the ec eu had to rely on nato following the end of the cold war , the eu promptly showed its helplessness at peacekeeping in the yugoslav civil wars boast about the eu as a " guarantor of peace " all you like , the claim does not stand up to scrutiny
6	i have no idea why ( maybe i'm an imbecile as well ) but i found this comment insanely hilarious
1	if you 're not protecting your local food production , you 're a bloody idiot ( to put it mildly ) true , and as oil ( and therefore transportation ) prices increase and the odd food shortage panic pops up , i suspect this will kill ' free ' trade as we know it now
1	if you 're not protecting your local food production , so tell me why the number of family owned farms , who are allegedly to benefit from all this money , has been dropping for years , whereas industrial agriculture has been on the rise ? the average income of your farmers has not been improved that much either and food prices in the eu were not spared from the effects of the <> <> world food price crisis , were they ? you 're a bloody idiot ( to put it mildly ) look in a mirror , sport
4	good for them the people should be speakin out anyone you talk to has something bad or even shocking to say about their government but we all have to realize the government works for the people we ' re those fuckers bosses and they need to be reminded americans should be following europeans example your country is full of good honest people but you have the shadyest government of all and there fucking you ! and there talkin otter country 's down with it you guys need to fix this from the inside out
2	the article does much to talk about where people are today ( screwed and frustrated ) and some to talk about how they got there ( corrupt politicans working with corrupt banks ) and surprisingly little about possible solutions rearranging debts is not going to help anymore ultimately there is going to have to be a lot of debt forgiveness , or else nations are going to have to go bankrupt and start over the only way this wo n't happen again in the future , is if the corrupt banking industry and corrupt politicians are regulated and monitored properly in the future
1	the issue is there , but a tad exaggerated , the fact is no matter what you do , you can not completely satisfy everyone also , still doing <> better than america , u mad ?
6	well , there is a pointer to a very new world as the bigger systems get more integrated , subsidiarity really works and aberdeen focuses just on off shore engineering , delft just on education around engineering and geology here a retirement district , there a region specialising in elecronics start ups lots of economic logic to this , and a great deal of evidence that it is how clusters of ability function at their best but then we look across at liverpool , or the abandoned centres of old industry across europe , and wonder who and what concentrates in those ? well , you see run down districts in cities would they be any different ? is this not what house prices and rents do to populations anyway ? if we go that way , it will be the end of the nation state one sees , instead , a set of levels at which administration , economic oversight and so on are handled , and a maze of microscopic , largely self governing enities clustered around their particular specialisation
8	reading article " kafka esque " stopped reading article skimmed through the judgment continued reading the article
2	i 'd rather want highly educated foreign people than domestics with bullshit degrees
1	it 's usually a bit of both it 's pretty damn hard to sell your products if nobody has any money , so it 's kinda silly to claim that big company x is making more profit by prolonging a crisis
6	( some ) youth are looking for someone to blame commerce gets unreasonably rich when what are called " alienable rents " ar ecreated monopolies , narrow information bases , protectionism all of that gets bundled as " mercantalism " argentina under peron , or germany under hilter were good examples of this wages were forced down , and anly a few firms were allowed to operate through , for example , export or production licenses leading to a sittuation with with minimal competition what you have in europe is almost teh exact opposite of this wages held up , firms prevented from making their workforce fully productive , a host of regulations and a sprawling state the consequence is sluggish activity and , where this fungus has been allowed to grow without check , crisis as the floor boards give way activists love a clear target , a class enemy but alas for them , " we have met the enemy , and the enemy is us "
2	one thing i can say for sure , the main problem are corrupt politicians that serve the bankers big corp and not the people welcome to the world though i do admit , your country is my favorite of all the european nations i 've visited , and i wish no ill upon you just keep on keepin on and keep your country as gorgeous and fun as ever edit grammar
1	networking is never ever going to go out of style , i know it sucks , but you ca n't realistic expect that people do n't speak to friends and family about a position that has opened up in their company about the other things , vote people in office that do something about it and if they do n't , vote for somebody else you are not going to change the things that are fucked up by just sitting in a square in lisbon and chanting that everythings bad oh and if all politicians are bad , why not go into politics yourself ? if it 's all that corrupt , you must get an instant following
2	i enough people ca n't find jobs or some form of support then they will make one of three choices die , crime , or revolution
5	in other words , europe ( and the rest of the western world ) is catastrophically overpopulated it 's time to subsidize birth control and even abortions on a massive scale , and to stop and reverse immigration
6	young europeans do n't see how the eu helps them ? surely the author has heard of the erasmus programme
3	it seems like a lot of people without jobs are n't happy and have time on their hands they want an income , but do n't fundamentally have any idea what changes they would actually want to make to get there many of them also seem to have chosen studies that have only vague job prospects sagarra physicist gil international relations boyer engineer , worked as a technical sales consultant but " felt a deep sense of unease about the world " dekoumes works for his father who has a shop selling motorcycle tires karl " stacks beverage cases by day " , but went to school for sociology and political science when the economy 's booming , or at least growing quickly , you can often study whatever you find interesting , and eventually you 'll find someone who 's willing to pay you to work when the economy shrinks , if you did n't choose a career that 's in demand , it will be hard to find work it 's a hard lesson to learn , and with decades of economic growth , one that seems to have been forgotten , but it 's true the problem is n't " europe " or " angela merkel " or " bankers " it 's just the way things are if your skills are n't in high demand , you wo n't always be able to find a job
2	it 's not just the youth in europe north and south american youth are feeling the same kind of pain the babyboomers generational sense of entitlement and greed is the true culprit
2	i'm not a rocket surgeon , but i believe the guy was being sarcastic
1	the european council is made up of the heads of the member states plus the eu president they in turn appoint the commission the current mess was caused by de gaulle he wanted member states to directly control everything because he did n't want the uk joining much of the current stand off in the eu can be traced back to this one man
1	far too often i find myself writing out a huge response and saying " fuck it " before i delete the whole thing this time i said " fuck it " before replying to you giving thanks for the well thought out post
4	well said
2	bullshit it did n't get more expensive ( http www bundesbank de <> images grafik1 <> en png ) speculative bubbles in property and banking only happened in some euro countries and absolutely not in others , those were completely dependent on the policies of the respective country and not the eu those poor unaccountable governments who " got away " with their economic foolishness , if only someone could have stopped them clearly if i give you my car and you get drunk and crash it taking out a whole lot of inoccent bystanders , it is my fault for giving you the car the us constitution has not the scope the eu constitution would have had , it stems from a whole different legal history the population growth is not uniform across europe ( http en wikipedia org wiki file demographics of europe svg ) , while some countries have a ( big ) problem it is nothing unmanageable
8	you can blame the government and the banks for the bursting of the economic bubble , but what the government has done since has been positive , just not enough last i read , krugman was saying that the second great depression had been avoided , but that we were in for a very long period of " jobless recovery " but , my point was more that for a very long time people have been able to study whatever they felt was interesting without regard for how useful it was in finding a job , and now that the economy is n't nearly as strong as it was , that 's coming back to bite them the severity of the economic downturn means that even people who had good job prospects are now hurting , but the ones who are the worst off are the ones who studied pretty impractical things i see the benefit of learning for the sake of learning , but , at the same time , i hope the long term result of this is that more people take a more pragmatic approach at choosing what they 're going to study so that when there are the future inevitable economic downturns , they are more secure
4	yeah , he and the guy selling motorcycle tires have chosen education training with good job prospects engineers seem to stay in demand , and it 's not possible to outsource things like working on motorcycles , so there will always be some local demand there the rest of them , however
2	it 's not about europe vs the us vs china anymore , it 's about a money based system that is inherently broken and makes no sense vs a reason and resource based one money represents resources we 're at our absolute peak as a species as far as technology , productivity and knowledge goes , and we 're still not even feeding all humans everywhere in fact , a billion of us are currently going hungry what the hell is up with that ? if we 're at our technological peak , how can you suggest that humanity changes to a system that relies on technology that does n't exist ? how anyone can argue that a money and profit based system works with that fact and all these other facts lined up to boot is completely beyond me because it works better than any other system the venus project and the zeitgeist movement are repackaged communism given that every attempt to implement it at a national level resulted in economic disaster , where millions died in large nations , how can you seriously recommend them ?
5	considering how much grief turkey gave to israel for that flotilla bullshit , i think turkey is being pussies when confronted with real guns on their border it was ok for turkey to condemn israel for " atrocities " committed by israel , but when it is happening in front of their very eyes on their border , they are wussing out just saying it is no big surprise to see the turks live with what seems to be a genocide happening right in front of their eyes and do nothing they have a past
6	agreed , also still waiting for us and european to bomb the syria why has n't this happened yet ?
3	that 's narrow minded in the extreme there 's a little more at stake here
4	i'm actually for this ! i mean , i 'll gladly start paying for music movies instead of pirating them , if it means that online credit card fraud , child pornography , and the rest of unlawful activity are potentially stopped does your privacy mean so much to you that you would n't stop potential victims of crime , being victimized at all ? ! ? ! ? all the gov ' t would learn from my internet usage , is that i visit reddit far too often , and that i like internet porn fill your boots
4	and the police has also admitted they do n't use all the eu mandated data that is logged about internet traffic either so this is just an example of bureaucrats being assholes more interesting is that there is a good chance this is against eu privacy laws already and the human rights convention
6	i'm saying that i was unable to find the " politiken " article i checked the page again and i still ca n't find it if you see it , could you please link to it ?
6	of course the police want to id you to use the net they want id on everything you do they want to know what dead trees you read , what you buy , who you talk to , what you say , what ( il ) legal meds you take and more no is the only answer
2	shit
2	i had hoped this was n't true , so i bought today 's printed politiken , and it 's all in there the headline translated " suggestion all use of the internet will be registered " the politiken article includes a lot of critique aimed at the suggestion , and the one from computerworld is just a shortened version of it , sans the " expert opinions " here 's an example of the criticism ( translated to the best of my abilities ) " we have become democratically lazy , and do not imagine that this kind of of data can be misused but of course it can it 's an unnecessary and effect less intrusion in people 's privacy the ones who this means to stop , will find another way the terrorists will always be one step ahead " i hope this shit does n't make it past this so called " working group " it 's very upsetting that our politicians are willing to sell out on people 's privacy for the sake of fighting an illusory threat on top of that , the danish police seem to be doing alright stopping terrorism without having to keep tabs on all our citizens idiots
6	i did n't know denmark suffers so much from terrorism
6	this certainly sounds serious , but i 've looked around and have n't been able to find any other sources for this google shows one other article which seems to be a word for word copy of this one i do n't subscribe to politiken , so i do n't know if it was in the print version for today and has n't been put online yet ( it 's not on their site at any rate ) and it 's not on the ministry of justice 's site ( http www justitsministeriet dk ) either my hunch is therefore that these are rumours speculations which have been exaggerated at any rate , until i see another source , i'm very skeptical
2	what ? ah , it 's a recommendation by a working group under the justice department the current set of danish politicians both in government and opposition may be incompetents , but they ought to barely recognise a political suicide when they see one if not , they can be made to learn what one looked like and if that is n't enough we 'll see the bastards in the streets and my axe
4	yeah good luck with that
5	this is disappointing
4	perfect , musicians might get to eat finally
1	i'm danish , and fuck everything about that
2	historically they were quite innovative with a lot of different technologies , being at the forefront of introducing them in production models these days ? they 're a car like any other except the fact that the company ca n't handle their finances worth a shit and so it 's falling apart
5	gm went bankrupt the u s government stepped in an basically divided the company into three parts what was still making money and could be resurrected into some sort of gm <> <> what was losing money and would continue to do so ad infinitum ( which the government held onto and is slowly writing off ) and what they could fold or sell in the third group were makes like saab , saturn , and hummer ( pontiac was closed a year before the bankruptcy ) saab they sold to spyker , a dutch firm hummer was sold to a chinese manufacturer , and saturn was shut down at the time , there was quite a bit of concern as to whether a small market sports car maker could make a go of a more mainstream brand apparently , we have our answer sadly
6	they used to be a successful company i'm not sure what you 're talking about
6	that 's what unions are intended to do , but do n't always after highschool ( in canada ) i wanted to be an ame ( aircraft maintenance engineer ) , school was <> <> a year depending on which , but on the job you are legally accountable for the work you do , and can go to jail for a mistake you make as much , or often less than an auto mechanic does , and the airline companies treat you like dirt , forced to work on call through the middle of the night , often sent on trips and sleep in the dirtiest and cheapest motels the company can find they are behind a union that all the workers hate , they have n't had a pay raise in ages , after talking to many , i was told it 's not something i should get into , many of them regret it and say do n't join if you want money , join if you love planes as well the best jobs are in the private sector out of the union , for businesses or people that own their own aircraft
4	lol , in the netherlands we have a catering union workers will since this year only get a pay increase every <> years and get paid <> overwork i have no idea why they still exist if they only serve for the business ' agenda
1	here ' s your fucking rent kitchenwindow
4	i thought they were finally back on track a month ago it 's a shame , i was hoping to see saab return to it 's pre gm glory days
8	cannot or does not want to ? if saab is sincere they need to open their accounting books to every worker so that they can all decide what to do having all the information at hand business owners lie about their ability to pay all the time
4	the <> jaguar xkr s is probably the sexiest looking car i 've ever seen
6	i thought saturn was bought by spyker ? edit googled it , you 're right , but apparently the saturn deal never materialized
6	off topic question what makes saab cars so good ?
4	i loved all my saabs , up untill gm owned them completely saab viggen ftw !
8	wow , i thought saab went bankrupt last year
6	what will jerry seinfeld drive now ?
4	they made good quality cars too bad everybody else can do that too except the russians no , antonov , you ca n't buy saab for the last time i
4	no worries they just lost volvo to china so they 'll sell saab to india or something
6	this is why unions are bad for business if they were not unionized saab would have no trouble paying their workers a fair wage
4	jaguar is indian now and the new models look awesome do n't hate just because the parent company is n't european
6	saab is known for sedans , not sports cars in fact i do n't even think they made a sports car since the gm ownership
6	saab have lots of models in the uk , not just small market sports cars in fact , i ca n't think of any small saabs
2	you have no idea what you are talking about
1	fuck europeans their ancestors are responsible for the vast majority of human misery the world over ! fuck europe !
5	something i do n't understand what exactly is so bad with just letting greece default on its debt ? i do n't see why the germans or french should bail them out here 's what they 're worried about greece defaults german and french banks which own the debt go bust as a result i say , who cares ? let all the idiots involved go bankrupt bailouts just encourage more irresponsible behavior banks will always lend to basket case countries like greece , because they believe their investment will be bailed out my the more stable countries yes , if some german banks go down , their economy will have short term problems with lending but in that case , just provide an infusion of capital to good banks that were n't so irresponsible with their lending if your economy is facing a liquidity crisis , better to help good banks expand than to help prop bad banks up
1	you mean those same ancestors that colonized north america and australia ? so actually fuck europe , north america and australia ? to judge people on what their ancestors did seems so reasonable
8	sorry , but this post has been removed from the sidebar this reddit is for major news from around the world except us related news ( especially us politics )
2	as a belgian ( belgium is neighbouring the netherlands ) this worries me seems that hate speech is becoming more and more acceptable
8	one problem for would be adopters is working out what they are signing up to there was a no bail out clause the idea was that the euro could potentially create a moral hazard greece could borrow lots of euro 's secure in the knowledge that germany would bail it out but there was a no bail out clause if greece borrowed too much , it would be on its own that has n't worked out one reason is that greece not only borrowed too much but borrowed it from german banks , so the germans are on the hook for greek debt anyway so what are the rules for the currency union that latvia is considering joining ? if portugal gets into trouble will latvia have to contribute to a bail out ? " i know the rules say no bail out , but sometimes you have to do things anyway " if latvia gets into trouble will portugal contribute to a bail out ? " sorry , no rules are rules , you knew what the rules were when you joined if you did n't like them you should have stayed out " latvia risks joining a club with the rule " heads i wind , tails you lose "

6	" your " does n't imply anything it 's by definition possessive

4	so , there 's no writing regarding the qualifiers for the exceptions ? i'm happy to see net neutrality passed , but it 's rather vague
3	yet again the dutch are awesome seriously considering moving there if i can !
6	when i read the headline i thought you meant car traffic then i saw spam and got confused
2	sounds a bit stupid why should n't internet providers have the right to slow down users traffic under certain circumstances ? it 's their business and if you do n't like it vote with your wallet and move to another provider
6	but does that still allow them to selectively choose which traffic to slow down ? if they have to slow down all traffic or nothing at all that makes it more difficult to use it as a loophole
4	sorry , i am a little uncertain ( disclaimer i didnt read the article very closely , dont be too pissed ) , but i do n't really know if this is a good or bad thing sounds good to lay me ?
5	i feel truly sorry you americans have to think that way
6	that 's not how it works here
6	where are you from that ' voting with your wallet ' actually works with regards to telecommunication services ?
2	from my perspective , all other traffic is spam causing congestion and possibly threatening my security
4	well , yes otherwise there would be no point
2	i hate when submitted articles are behind paywalls
4	pay to read more no thankyou does this even work in this day and age
2	it 's a bluff they do n't actually have that capacity
4	that 's a cute threat and all , but they do n't have any excess capacity to flood out iran if they had excess capacity we would n't be tapping into strategic reserves right now
1	how is possible that you 're all so retarded that you have n't figured out you can google the title ( http lmgtfy com ? q saudi suggests <> <> iran over nuclear ambitions ) and click on the first link ? why on every fucking wsj do derpers gotta derp ?
6	does this even work in this day and age err yes ? the wsj typically has very high quality articles quality is worth paying for and even if you do n't understand that point , they have many thousands of subscribers
8	it is not about having markets to sell to , it is about dropping the bottom out of the price of oil iran is pretty financially strapped and the only thing keeping things calm at home for them is the price of oil being so high lately if oil prices fall deeply , iran will have to cut many services domestically which will erode support for the government from a population that is barely supporting it now
4	that link does n't work for me , i get the same two and a half sentences do n't get me wrong , thanks for taking the time to offer it , i just think that wsj links should be in their own subreddit , and i'm using your comment as a place to rant i 've deleted my cookies , cleared my cache , used a different browser , switched ip 's , and searched for the headline on google i 've done this in other threads were people claim they have a working link , as well maybe the wsj have my computer fingerprinted as an undesirable the only option working option i can think of is for someone to copy paste the article into the thread , but i guess the wsj would get choked if someone fixed their broken piece of the internet for them in such a way
6	i'm certainly no expert but do you really think saudi is pumping at full capacity now ? i ask because i do n't know , and appreciate informed opinion , which i am not
7	i hope the jury that found him not guilty can sleep at night btw when a link shows random facebook posts , you really get a look into the wacky world of humanity
1	i fucking knew he did it
2	yeah , we all knew he did it , but the news here is that he finally admitted to it what bothers me , though , is that he 's probably going to make money out of his admission by appearing on shows and selling the story
2	we 're all innocent in here , did n't you know that ?
2	so the cops framed a guilty man ?
8	to be fair , this article says he claims he stabbed her in self defense which is n't exactly him admitting to murder
8	american justice
1	clearly the poor guy is being framed again why ca n't he just get some justice ?
6	simpson confessed to a producer for oprah winfrey , and he will reportedly repeat the confession to winfrey during a televised interview he 's probably going to make money out of it
4	he must need money for commissary i hear top ramen is getting pretty expensive in the joint
3	he did promise he 'd find the killer nailed it
6	self defense ? then why did he kill goldman ?
2	simpson claimed he stabbed nicole in self defense cue scumbag meme confess to crime keep lying about it
1	simpson claimed he stabbed nicole in self defense fuck that shit her head was almost decapitated ! if you 've ever seen the pictures or read the description of the scene , it was a vicious murder
5	i'm sorry , did i miss something ? i thought oprah retired and the show went off the air ? was n't that what all the hoopla was about , a month or so ago ? there was a great deal of it , the hoopla
8	he 'll have a hard time keeping the money he makes he still owes the goldman family for the wrongful death lawsuit as well as any monetary penalty he received for this robbery
3	the jury was sequestered and not allowed to see the same evidence we saw the prosecution did a horrible job
4	yea , right like there was ever any doubt
6	i hope the jury that found him not guilty can sleep at night why should n't they the prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt

2	i do n't think anyone really thinks that the us went in after terrorists the natural resources were always the reason just like in lybia
1	if you think you can understand war without data , you are part of the problem you are also part of the problem if you think data is all you need to understand war ) (
4	i meant arnie gundersen , and i do n't really follow michio kaku either thanks for letting linking to that article on reactor four that is good news
4	i meant arnie gundersen , and i do n't really follow michio kaku either thanks for linking to that article on reactor four that is good news
6	reactor pool <> was empty was it ? it does not seem so ( http atomicinsights com <> <> nrc professional staff brief very good news unit <> pool never dry html )
8	gladly it will release more radiation if it has n't already , it will contaminated more land if it has n't already , the water table will be contaminated which is very bad , the reactor cores are burrowing into the concrete foundation , the concrete foundation has large fractures and fissures in it , they do n't expect to achieve a cold shutdown for at least a year ( it does not look like they 're going to meet that deadline ) , there are <> nuclear reactors that have not only fully melted down but also melted through the containment vessels , and to top it all off , they have absolutely no idea what to do about it because they ca n't seal it in a sarcophagus like they did at chernobyl for various reasons , and there is really no other solution this kind of nuclear catastrophe should not have happened and , since it should have been such an unlikely occurrence , it was not planned for if you do n't believe me then you are in denial because i have said nothing that has n't been widely reported on already if you want a source , then use google you 're a big boy , you do n't need me to hold your hand
5	you do realize that i said that he has n't claimed anything that jeopardizes his stance as an authority figure and an expert , right ? a lot of experts thought that reactor pool four was empty that bit of news you linked me to is good news and recent news sorry for missing it , but , up to this point , most experts thought it was empty also , they still do n't know for sure if it was or was n't completely empty , but what we do know for sure is that reactor cores were , with out a doubt , exposed to air and probably still are since reactor building four blew up and all the machinery and structures are in ruins
5	it will release more radiation if it has n't already , it will contaminated more land if it has n't already , so basically , " already worse than chernobyl " means " might be worse than chernobyl later " got it it 's like harold camping , if shit happens you get to claim your guess was due to foresight and not a guess the reactor cores are burrowing into the concrete foundation and your proof that it 's still the thousand celsius inside the reactor that would be necessary to do this is what ? all actual evidence is that it 's nowhere near that temperature anymore and wo n't be going back to that unless cooling is interrupted again there are <> nuclear reactors that have not only fully melted down but also melted through the containment vessels there 's no evidence they 've melted through their containment vessels , only their pressure vessels go ahead , try to find real evidence of this ( you 're a " big boy " like you said , right ? ) , then when you ca n't , ask yourself why the sites you were reading would lie to you there 's a big difference between the containment vessels leaking water in places the core having actually left the containment vessel
5	do n't mean to sound like an ass but is dr kaku , actually qualified or knowlegable enough to be an expert on the current situation in japan , or is it simply of his opinion , that it is a ' ticking time bomb ' ?
1	michio kaku 's a fucking liar everyone on that joke of a " news network " is
1	please , do not insult the reddit holy cow , nuclear power
6	funny you should mention that because the us media sure is n't
8	dr kaku is a theoretical physicist he is definitely an authority figure he may have his biases , but he is definitely worth taking seriously
7	actually , he 's not " japan 's " version of anything he was born and raised in san jose just a nitpick makes no difference of his opinions on this accident
8	arnie gundersen has proven to be very reliable in his predictions and has not said anything that jeopardizes his reputation as an authority figure and an expert also , michio kaku is a theoretical physicist , which is a title that should not be dismissed so readily both of these people should be taken seriously
8	michio kaku is a theoretical physicist yes , but theoretical physics is a different field of study than applied nuclear physics or the industry of nuclear energy one can be an expert in aerodynamics without having flown a jet having not visited the fukushima site himself , like everybody else he relies only on reports from observers about what 's going on inside each of those reactors he can speculate , and you can take him seriously if you like , but one must treat his analysis as only that
1	arnie gundersen has proven to be very reliable in his predictions oh , you mean like this when he claimed reactor <> 's pool was empty ( http www youtube com watch ? v d6dzqzy k2c ) ? or maybe like this when he was claiming it was worse than chernobyl ( http www youtube com watch ? v lnjf4whnta4 ) ? maybe he was confused because he claims to have far more experience than he does ( http atomicinsights com <> <> arnie gundersen has inflated his resume yet frequently claims that entergy cannot be trusted html ) the media loves him because he makes these big claims and they do n't care when he 's just bullshitting as it gets viewers the same situation exists with kaku but it 's not all the media 's fault , they 're feeding an increasingly uncritical and trusting population
5	maybe he was confused because he claims to have far more experience than he does oh , this old hat i keep forgetting about it
1	and the disaster is worse than chernobyl it 's released less radiation , contaminated less land , and harmed fewer people explain
2	reactor pool <> was empty and the disaster is worse than chernobyl
5	rape and sexual assault does not apply to the powerful and mighty in the french republic women should be happy to be rapped by french politicians , it is the french way dsk will buy his way out of the us court system ( come on , a rich white man accused of raping a black maid , in the us , the maid is sure to be deported and have to pay damage to dsk ) , but in france , she would already be in jail
2	you do n't think that a country rife with militant jihadists will praise a man who attempted to murder someone for slandering muhammad ? it 's happened already with some returnees from guantanamo , as well as the guy who planned the pan am <> bombing
4	excellent that 's actually an extremely harsh sentence by scandinavian standards , which shows the danes take this seriously
4	oh , i get it , because somalia is that country where people are always shooting one another oh , it 's fun to make fun of them !
1	is it possible to stay there for over <> years ? like if there is a good chance of the person repeating the crime
8	if you 're referring to kubrick 's version then , yes , that 's blasphemy
4	well im from denmark , but i was speaking generally but it seems like it only goes one way the french does n't have that many words that look english or danish , the same go for the germans though it have changed a lot the last fifty years , where new english words is more common pc or computer are good examples even though they have their own words for it too but our words and language is very much depended on where we get our cultural impact from
2	not everyone in denmark are violent douchebags though
8	but holland is a region of the netherlands texas and the us are popularly interchangeable does n't make it any more correct edit ok , maybe a better example is that america and the us are used interchangeably
1	you 're a fucking idiot
3	this has been going on in quite a few threads
2	left arms are typically worthless
8	it 's called selective reporting , jesus people , use your heads
3	i still think it 's silly to charge someone for ' terrorism ' , especially in cases where it makes more sense to charge them for old fashioned crimes like in this case breaking and entering , threatening with a deadly weapon , violence against a police officer and attempted murder
3	on the other hand , the terrible conditions in us prisons basically set the inmates up to re offend later even if there is a playstation , having your freedom taken away is still a serious punishment we do n't need to torture people we need to remove the causes of crime
5	also a much more homogenous population , for now we 'll see how you deal with non white diversity in the coming decades , as the muslims continue to poor in it does n't look good so far though , does it ? ask the french
2	are you saying that somali refugee did not try to kill a danish man over a fucking cartoon ? has foxnews somehow lied in this particular instance ? explain
1	he did n't piss of ' his own danish citizens ' he did , however piss of some nutcase muslims and he did that knowing what could happen this was not about freedom of speech , people who argue that are very ignorant to the fact that freedom of speech does not exist over nation borders , it 's not some universal right no , the cartoons was one mans idea of profiting from a certain situation i say , go ahead and profit , good for you if you pull it of , but do n't come whining when shit like this happen
1	" black people are still called nigger , and they are so proud of it they wo n't call you black , but prefer that term see to them , it does n't matter that the term is insulting , what matters is what they think the term means , so they keep using it and to hell with if other people get upset " where in the world do you get this from sir ? yes , some people here are racists just as some are in every country in the world the term nigger is most often seen upon as a soft swear word here ( in denmark ) , and it 's mostly old people who use the term , as that 's what they grew up with and they are stubborn it saddens me to read that you have had a bad experience here , but of course it depends on the place you 've been and the people you 've met some people do fear foreign people here , with the reason usualy being the fear of terrorist or the media 's role in highlighting foreigners crimes
1	that is because it is filled with somalians
2	christianity deserves all the same criticisms that islam does
2	i know it is fucking annoying to get people like you described , in my community but i guess a lot of nationalities struggle with this it 's human to not like a people only because of a few bad encounters we only remember the bad things that happened to us , say , yesterday thanks for the kind words you happen to be fnnish ?
8	yeah , my previous comment seemed like trying to sound " deep " for some moron maybe i am trying to explain that someone might perceive comic of their holy figure as not trivial matter and people knew that so why are you acting like its some surprise
4	agreed and agreed time to end irrelevant discussion before we get downvoted to hell
2	well it 's not like they can worsen your death penalty
7	i understand you are a good person i mean that
2	there may be a lot of them , but there are a lot of fucked up things happening because of islam and a lot of people perpetrate these acts or fail to condemn them with enough force i know it 's cool to support the underdog and whatnot but jsut open your eyes , the world does not prosper where islam prevails
2	shit sorry
7	unless they capped the article with " and it was all obamas fault , " i'm not sure what about this does n't qualify as news in your eyes
1	anyone willing to kill someone else for religion should be locked away for life or deported into space
4	that 's actually a good question it 's the intention and attempt that really matters in a legal sense as far as i'm concerned , not the outcome of the attempt same for every crime , really attempted robbery should have the same sentence as succeeded robbery
1	terrorism is to spread terror in a population is n't it terror , to vow you will kill anyone who draws a specifik cartoon ? it is terror when you try to inhibit people through their feir for you
2	it 's just a nut trying to kill someone with a religious motivation that 's a beautiful summary of fundamentalist terrorism
1	you dont really know shit about scandinavian prison sentences do you ? <> years is a harsh sentence around here
1	fuck fox news showing the logo itself is a much bigger crime downvoted you brainwashed peon
1	downvoted for linking to fox news next time , please try to find an article on an actual fucking news site , not a propaganda machine thank you fyi iluvpi linked to an alternate source , in another comment , here ( http www reddit com r worldnews comments i7g9d somali man who tried to kill the danish c21i4iz )
2	is european justice a joke or something ? premeditated murder gets like <> years right ?
1	just more proof to show how worthless muslims are to society sigh
2	fox news is dying for us to start thinking of muslims as extremists again they also want to associate hackers with " terrorists " http www foxnews com scitech <> <> <> hacker vs hacker group races police to expose lulzsec fuck fox bunch of propaganda
2	just <> yeas ? i wish he would 've robbed <> from a us bank afterwards (
3	people in europe have panic rooms people in us have panic armories
1	it 's not politically incorrect , it 's just incorrect , unintelligible bullshit i'm sure the british had the same thing to say about the irish in the <> century , retard the mistake many racists make is to think people hate them because they are offensive no , we dislike you because your world view has no scientific basis ( race is a social not a genetic construct ) , just the same way we dislike the creationists
1	living in sweden where we got a shitload of somali immigrants as well as quite a few gypsys
6	i love lastpass , but res is better for quickly switching reddit accounts in fact , i think there 's an option to select which username to use when posting ? ( i do n't have any novelty accounts , so i have all that disabled )
4	nice try lastpass ceo
2	dude , nobody really listens to muslims when they are n't blowing up things which is kind of problematic which thing do you think is the better newspaper article " twenty muslims kill themselves as suicide bombers ! " or " <> <> billion muslims did n't bomb anything at all today ! "
1	definitely what are you on ? i meet muslims almost everyday and that is in a christian country
2	look , i resent most of the statements here , cause i'm somali but the thruth of the matter is , that what you say is bullshit it 's the stupidity of clan and bloodwar that has driven somalia into the ditch it 's in today
2	that 's not true somalia tried to start a democracy , which worked for a while , but fell because of clan tribal loyalties after that it 's been pretty crappy and somalia was n't abused for " centuries "
2	how did the europeans end up in south africa ? humans always move if the conditions are favorable
6	scandinavian countries have been big on this " we can save the world by accepting lots of refugees ! multiculturalism ! if there 's problems , just throw money at it and it will all work out " it has not worked very well
1	maybe he got on the wrong bus
1	sources would be nice i believe i 'd hear republicans bashing obama for literally " palling around with terrorists "
2	damn straight
5	as a preclude to my response , i would like to say this libya bullshit you are ranting about has nothing to do with the article posted now are you being serious ? ? lollllll gaddafi being secular ( http en wikipedia org wiki islam in libya islam in revolutionary libya ) listen man , you can hate the west all you want i may agree that i find the religious positions of the revolution groups dubious but you should n't idealize gaddafi just because you hate the west we did , if you remember , stop his army just before they were about to , in all likelihood , massacre a city you immediately make yourself less serious a voice by idealizing gaddafi edit first source would n't link resorted to wiki
2	please give us examples of these harmful cartoons which you speak of
7	we live in a certain kind of civilized society someone who takes to violence because of some scribbles on paper , no matter how offensive they are , is rightly classed as a savage
6	a non harmless cartoon ? you gotta explain to me papercut , maybe ? i do n't know
2	fake germans ouch you 'd make a lot of danes angry with that if you mentioned it to their faces ( try it at a bar for a face smashing experience ) in copenhagen replace german with swedish for the same sort of fun
8	i 've seen college educated americans make this mistake before feel free to take an informal poll of passersby in a typical american city and see what their interpretation of the phrase " the netherlands " is i have no hard data to support this , but i bet that a substantial proportion , when asked to define the netherlands , would think it was a blanket term for all of northern europe
3	the man broke into the cartoonist 's house with an ax he said " he was trying to scare him " that 's what i do to try to scare people , really gets a good adrenaline rush going
2	well then do n't fucking move to saudi arabia
2	if you moved to saudi arabia hah i do n't think anyone who is n't a rich male arab would ever move there
2	true , i added the immigrant part because i felt someone my say " shut up you racist redneck " or something
8	nobody should , unless it 's an article bashing islam then it 's perfectly alright hilarious how this has a over <> on here when anything else coming from fox will get downvoted to oblivion on the basis it 's a propaganda outlet
2	it should only be linked to when there 's a story about shitty cops , amirite ?
6	let me guess fox news is propaganda because <> ) your jr college <> 's throwback professor told you so <> ) you read it on www conservativeseatchildren blogspot com <> ) that dude rachel maddow told you so im going with all of the above ! i win ! i win !
1	control f " link to fox news " nobody fucking cares you mindless asshole ! !
2	i do n't click on fox news links
2	yes , because fox news does not deserve any sort of ad revenue or encouragement through pageviews it is a cesspool
1	good about fucking time !
2	that sentence is a joke that man is a danger to all other men and should not be in society
6	why is there a lesser sentence for attempted murder ?
1	they should lock him up for life and stuff him with pork ten years is too little
4	fun fact the uprising that occurred in libya this past march was supposed to be a commemoration of the violent <> protests in benghazi against the danish cartoon depictions of muhammad these religious fundamentalist cartoon protestors are the same " rebels " that nato currently supports but why would they be protesting against gaddafi , you ask ? because gaddafi himself is a rather secular ruler who wants to open up libya to become a nation of religious tolerance something else he 's been trying to do is nationalize the oil companies operating in libya in order to keep more of libyan natural resource wealth for libyans the u s and the rest of the western world do n't really give a fuck about religious tolerance , but they do care about oil and so they did what they always do support a rebellious faction within the country to overthrow its government , in order to eventually replace it with one more amenable to western causes the irony this time is that the faction that we found to support is actually a bunch of islamic fundamentalist extremists put another way if these people lived in iraq or afghanistan or even iran , they would be called al qaeda but they live in libya , and more importantly they oppose gaddafi , and so they are not al qaeda they are rebels , or freedom fighters , or whatever euphemism is trendy nowadays they fight for peace and democracy and freedom , against a man who in his <> year reign transformed libya into one of the most prosperous and egalitarian countries in all of africa raped and murdered his own people tl dr nato is currently supporting a libyan al qaeda overthrow its secular ruler they think they 're fighting for islam the western world thinks they 're fighting for " freedom " they 're really fighting for oil
2	great , only another <> years and he 'll be ready to cut my head off too
2	i ca n't believe this sort of cave man shit is still going on thank you irrational thought and religion
6	why 'd you link to fox news ?
2	are you serious ? ever heard of the ira , eta ? who released anthrax in the usa white extremist group remember the balkan war ? the countries killing shit loads of people in iraq afganistan , which group do they belong to now again ? does that shit happen every day though ? ira and eta are pretty much over , as are the balkan wars yes , the us is killing people in iraq afghanistan but are they doing it in the name of their religion ? eh , the entire usa is raging over , for them , non issues happening in another country they ca n't even point to on a map not exactly sure what you 're referring to here , but there 's a big difference between raging over something and violently raging over something
6	well , would you say that muslims in general are doing a good job at showing they are different from the radical islamists ?
1	a smaller group should be a near accurate representation of the larger group that does n't work for axe murderers ( because they are really fucking rare )
4	god help us if they start interbreeding
6	and where do you get that from ?
2	yeah , he 's a terrorist because of his race
8	lol is there some way to make your username distinct each time you post a comment , or do people legit make new accounts every time they want to make a username joke ?
1	well you prove yourself to be the very fucking scumbag this world needs to get disposed of and you apparently think killing people is a good way to handle of people who does n't think like you and express their opinions well , that 's something you have in common with muhideen mohammed geelle knowing that some psychopath could stalk you , so you should n't do this or do that exactly means bowing your head to these illiterate monkeys fear mongering seems like you are the illiterate since i did n't write that on a side note , calling people ' monkeys ' reveals that you lack arguments and have to resort to name calling you also did n't mention who ' these ' refer to , so the sentence makes no sense nowhere in your post , or the previous ones , you mentioned a group which ' these ' can refer to , unless ' these ' means everyone who is n't ' his own danish citizens ' that , however , would make your sentence stupid
2	how is it racist ? surely it 's hateful towards somalians but i see no mention of race
1	for bringing axe to someones house and forgetting the keys ? amurica fuck yeah
1	your sentence could n't have made less sense engrish ! fuck yeh !
2	actually , <> years is pretty long for denmark i think <> years is the regular sentence for murder ( in extreme cases life , but that 's rarely more than <> ) i 'd have loved for this piece of shit to serve out his time in somalia though life in a danish prison is a holiday , especially if you are used to things in somalia
8	<> years is a long time , and harsher sentences does n't lower crime
4	this is good this stupid man failed on many levels when it comes to shari ' ah law he tried to kill someone for blasphemy , he tried to inflict too harsh a punishment for blasphemy without asking them to recant , he tried to punish a non believer for blasphemy which is impossible , he tried to punish a non believer who is protected in a completely different judicial system , he tried to punish someone without being a legitimate witness to the crime , he tried to punish someone without a court order and thus is a vigilante , he invaded someone 's privacy , he caused property damage , and he 's also probably lying about only trying to frighten him he did something idiotic and was tried under their law and got punished for it
2	r atheism is full of self righteous pricks every muslim i 've ever met has been secular and friendly it can go both ways
1	the way things work is n't a very good justification a tiger that can get to you presents an immediate danger the are a number of reasons this logic does apply to groups in most cases they do not represent an immediate threat and you have the time to evaluate the situation people automatically assume that groups whom they are not members of are more homogeneous than they actually are and because of this apply negative traits ( which are more commonly known due to the nature of news reporting ) to the entire group people tend to believe groups they are not members of are inferior there is of course more to group dynamics but suffice to say most people would disagree with many judgements applied to them due to group membership , and would have a reasonable basis for doing so
8	he did nothing wrong he excercised his freedom of speech , which is not only protected by law , it 's a goddamn foundation of western society
5	the thing is , that the group in question is so huge that one individual makes a very poor sample it 's human nature to do so , you just have to remind yourself that you have no basis for the assumption
1	in that case , all americans are stupid ( http activistsandairplanes com files <> <> george bush jpg ) all germans are cannibals ( http pysih com wp content uploads <> <> armin meiwes3 <> jpg ) and all the brits are john cleese this clearly is n't true , i have a german room mate and i have n't woken up one day to find a chunk of my flesh missing
2	that 's probably shitty as a somali myself , i can admit when things get shitty i love how denmark has become in the somali community since many of them started moving away , because of the tougher immigration laws though i do n't like how you group all somali together so please do n't do that yeah , many majority of somali that congregate in a city generally cause a lot of problems but there are still gold among our people , and they are the ones i do n't like to see get labeled
5	oh come on somalia is a pretty homogeneous country america is n't
2	well , western ' tribes ' do n't really go about pack raping and murdering anything they can find tell me , do you know of many other nations that have such an appaling daily way of life ? can these people not fucking learn ? ever seen that pic of rome <> years ago compared to africa , today ? it 's spot on
2	yeah , and rest of us are rejecting the level of cultural relativism you are suggesting say <> year old you and a friend named joey are playing in the park you and joey are joking around and you end up saying that joey says that he believes that the birds are his friends and he talks to them you say , " joe that is stupid ! birds are n't talking to you ! " joey pulls out a knife and stabs your neck does the adult you tell the <> year old you that joey just have different values and that you should understand ?
2	it 's a ten year holiday in a confined space , effectively being locked in a motel room , and all your neighbors are scary prisons are not supposed to be hellholes , the sentence is incarceration , being deprived of freedom the problem with locking religious nutwits up is that they tend to hang out together in prison and make each other even more fundamentalist that 's a problem everywhere , not just in scandinavian prisons
1	christianity has been pretty peaceful in the last few hundred years since you know , we stopped acting like barbarians if a christian kills someone in the name of god , they are fucked even other christians will hate them
6	except when were talking about republicans , fox news , or anything remotely right wing , amirite ?
8	we judge groups based on the actions of individuals all the time it 's not stupid , it 's just the ways things work you do n't give a tiger the benefit of doubt you assume it is dangerous based on experience and this experience is based on previous actions of members of its kind why should this simple logic not apply to groups of people as well ?
6	maybe they ought to reconsider giving safe harbour to people who are n't going to respect the law of the land
7	it has n't worked perfectly , but it 's certainly worked fairly well all immigrants go through a course in swedish culture and language , and most slot in to swedish society well the problems are with some ( but far from all ) muslims sweden takes in more refugees from iraq and afghanistan than the us does , and it is hard to get uneducated and nearly illiterate but deeply religious people to adapt to a modern secular society like sweden
2	i honestly do n't give a fuck about gaddafi or i did n't i certainly do n't idolize him on the contrary , it is the western media who demonizes him you sound almost proud to be parroting cnn or fox news or msnbc , all of whom say exactly the same thing on this topic that for some vague reason even though our economy is going bankrupt and we 're already committed to <> wars , our conscience is not going to allow us not to enter a <> one does that not sound even a little suspicious to you ? do you really think i " hate " the west ? do i hate freedom too ? how old are you ? do you realize you have a grade school understanding of politics and international relations ? everybody does at least everybody who believes we 're in libya to liberate some oppressed rebels from an evil massacring tyrant i am a proud american citizen that 's why i am fuming that my government has been hijacked by a bunch of con artists hell bent on waging war so that a few extremely rich people can get richer , while sons and daughters perish in battle and entire nations crumble to poverty did you know libya is one of the most prosperous nations in africa ? did you know its citizens enjoy a society more egalitarian than that of the united states , and that its citizens ' life expectancy is only a year lower than ours ? libya also has state sponsored health care and welfare programs , which were created by gaddafi along with other reforms dating back to the mid ' <> we are in libya invading the hell out of it and trying to oust gaddafi because in our view , gaddafi is stealing his nation 's oil that rightfully belongs to our western oil companies there are other possibly more important reasons too , but i'm trying to stay outside the realm of conspiracy theory everything i said can be verified as fact i'm not an america hating muslim supporter or something i do n't give a flying fuck about islam unless islam tries to fuck with me
2	should have gotten a longer sentence
6	will it actually be <> years or could he get paroled earlier ?
6	my question is , and this is an honest question , how does a somali man end up in scandinavia to begin with ?
8	i hope for the entire <> years they have someone outside of his cell continuously drawing pictures of " the prophet " and after he finishes one everyone in the prison comes over and takes a shit on it
2	in which case all of you is worthless
1	i hope you can pull your head out of your ass long enough to read these articles then , before claiming i " do n't know what i'm talking about " http www pbs org newshour bb religion july dec04 dutchmuslims <> <> htm http www npr org programs atc features <> feb europe muslims http www usatoday com news religion <> <> <> muslims veil france <> st n htm http www cfr org religion europe integrating islam p8252
8	i think you are right here but if it would be like raze78 says , that everybody uses the word nigger , because it means black person then it is not not insulting or offensive or a problem except for danish people abroad that have to watch their tounge because their word has a negative meaning in the english language
6	what ?
2	i resent that statement
1	damn somalians , they ruined somalia !
5	til people really need to get them self a new sarcasm detector
2	or you will be shaking in your little country fearing that crazy muslim with an axe will come and kill you
2	somalia sucks
8	wow , better than most of china where it 's around <> per day for around <> people when i was there i read about a particular region known for its poverty ( forget the name , famous for making illegal guns ) , where the average yearly income was <> ( <> )
4	thank god too bad he 'll have to spend <> years in a danish prison first that 'll probably be the best part of this sentence for him
6	oh you think attempted , premeditated murder should be less than <> years ?
1	or maybe the sentence was harder because he tried to kill someone !
8	um , more to the point , he tried to kill a man over a cartoon this is not rational , no matter if it were valid under shari ' a law or not
8	um , more to the point , he tried to kill a man over a cartoon this is not rational , no matter if it were valid under shari ' a law or not
6	what 's your point ?
1	you seem to have more faith in the danish prison system than i do , but yes , hopefully they 'll be able to turn him into a functioning member of society , who understands that you ca n't kill people just because they offend you and yes , i know you were just being sarcastic , but in some parts of the world , our correctional facilities are actual correctional facilities and not just places to lock away unwanted people
2	i know you 're probably being sarcastic , but judging a group by the actions of individuals is stupid
8	i'm not eight un workers were killed in afghanistan because of what a single pastor in the us did behind closed doors
6	i was more surprised to read that even up until <> people were still trying to hurt kill the people who worked for the newspaper that published those pictures
1	then fucking use google news and stop being an asshole
4	so in <> years he 'll come across the bulgarian border in a truck and finish the job nice
8	he 's also going to get deported , presumably to somalia somalia has a per capita gdp of about <> <> a day
6	would you trade your freedom or take your chances in that terrible terrible hellhole that you know so much about ?
2	that 's exactly why it 's harsh " oh my allah , i want to spent my entire life in this prison " " no you filth , you 'll only get ten years "
1	i blame the shining too for sucking so much
6	so weird
4	thank god , although i disagree about it being his weakest , the level of tension conveyed in that film is incredible also , the cinematography is amazing ! love me some kubrick
2	how so ? i compared danish to swedish and dutch to afrikaans since those two languages are more stereotypical then you tell me that each comparison i made is backed up by the languages having similar origins which i was fully aware of
4	lol
1	i'm finished with pc bullshit these people are fucked who cares wwhat they do to each other they do n't have the collective intellect to form a decent society obviously ! !
1	um , did i mention terrorist , you fucking dickhead
6	in broad strokes , you can start with scrutinizing more closely those refugees coming from countries known to contain pockets of religious extremism
1	for bringing an ax to someones house and forgetting the keys ? ftfy but it still does n't make sense in the context of the story the guy busted into somebody 's house with an ax with the intent of killing him for drawing a picture ! also throwing in " america fuck ya " is a non sequiter and pretty much seals the deal for people to completely disregard what you 're saying who wants to listen to somebody who is dumb enough to stereotype an entire country i guess in your world all italians are philanderers who work for the mob and all french people are snooty wine snobs and all africans are child soldiers and all chinese people are brilliant mathematicians get over yourself
6	maybe he eats out ?
2	ok , so how many stupid americans or cannibal germans must you see before you start to see a pattern ? <> ? <> ? <> ?
1	we 're white you fuck
4	thanks for the correction
1	negative thing about a muslim ? that ' s racist ! it ' s all america ' s fault ! our western materialism is what ' s causing this ! imperialism !
1	seriously , why the fuck go into someones country to disrupt and try to impose your beliefs if you do n't like free speech stay the fuck back in your own shithole country i can speak because i am an immigrant myself
4	appears i may have hit a nerve there lol
1	ok , so how many stupid americans or cannibal germans must you see before you start to see a pattern ? <> ? <> ? <> ? i'm going to go with " infinite " , on the basis that correlation is not causation
5	i maintain that compared to other groups the level of violence ( honor killings , suicide bombings , violent mobs angry about cartoons etc ) committed by people in the name of their religion is disproportionately higher for muslims are you serious ? ever heard of the ira , eta ? who released anthrax in the usa white extremist group remember the balkan war ? the countries killing shit loads of people in iraq afganistan , which group do they belong to now again ? where are the angry mobs of christians , atheists or buddhists raging violently about some non issue happening in another country they ca n't even point to on map ? eh , the entire usa is raging over , for them , non issues happening in another country they ca n't even point to on a map
3	quite a lot more than that there 's over <> million americans out there
8	depends on the kind of pattern you 're looking for all <> americans will have to , somehow , display their collective stupidity for all americans to fall in said category you just ca n't make disparaging remarks that are , at the same time , accurate no one can
4	exactly , i'm glad you see my point
4	i'm pretty sure the billion non violent practitioners of islam are a good sample
6	how large of a sample do you need for a group this large ? how large of a sample does it take for a disavowal be taken seriously ? polling agencies tackle these kind of questions every day a smaller group should be a near accurate representation of the larger group picking a representative group of a large ( very large ) group is difficult in itself automatically finding such a representative group among a bunch of people that have been involved in a horrific act ( s ) is just bad methodology <> <> " islamic " fuckwads ( edit that carry out these attacks ) are really angry men ( note quotation marks ) that is n't an accurate representation of the muslim world in general so we should n't judge an entire race by the actions of a group that does n't represent them properly or at all
4	i like that in the us it 's almost standard to repeal
8	indeed they are totally different bands
2	i guess that 's true , but how does that affect what we call it in english ? so the accidental implication that the usa and america are the same thing was wrong ? how relevant , hehe
1	i do n't think that this was the thought process of the convicted man , nor do i think that he respects the beliefs of others to him , there is one right and good belief , and the rest are wrong and evil it 's not a question of simply imposing his beliefs on another , it 's more a matter of " convert or die , because this is the only way "
1	this is just wrong if you moved to saudi arabia and wished that women should have more rights , they 'd probably say the exact same thing " why did you move here and not respect our beliefs that the women is subhuman ? " if it 's wrong , it 's wrong everywhere and if it 's right , it 's right everywhere now , threatening someone with an axe is wrong everywhere , and free speech is right everywhere but that 's not the point
5	we just call them refugees here who cares where they came from ?
6	there has n't been much said about the libya situation , the major news deliverers has more or less has treated it like " it 's good with revolutions , islam is bad " the worst thing about ghadaffi seems to be that he has big women as bodyguards if you go by big news apparently that is enough for people in general to support a revolution
1	what shithole country do you come from ?
1	what shithole country do you come from ?
1	what shithole country do you come from ?
4	i seriously do n't understand how people can mistake these two countries for one another even though our countries lie fairly close to each other , we do n't share that much history together compared to our neighbour countries and even though you may think our language sound familiar it 's not the same at all but we love beer , football and cycling , and that 's awesome
1	that is a common assumption , but wrong life is life but you can appeal for leniency after ( i think ) <> years and the typical length of time served is <> that said a four time police murder spent <> years and <> months in prison
1	christian hitler tried to killed all jews <> years ago anyway christians countries were not under attack , occupation and generally lots of foreign influence in last few decades if israel is marching it armies in your country every few years reducing everything to dust , if you see how american money are keeping obscenely rich king in power , if you see democraticly elected governments overthrown with support from the west you have some reason to resort to violence
1	anything negative about a jew even though it 's true ? antisemitism ! anything negative about a mulsim ? free speech hypocrisy like this always amuses me
2	crime is more prevalent in the us because you have no social security net while sweden do , aswell as socialized medicine that said , we have huge problems with cime ( compared to how sweden were just <> decades ago ) the sad truth is that we have a shitload of sandpeople and niggers raping and pillaging
4	that 's why he 's being deported after his sentence
6	how do you know if a refugee is going to respect the law or not ?
3	so you do n't see when american christian terrorists murder doctors or commit arson against abortion clinics ? odd
5	the entire population of the us did not and does not support the reasons we were given to go into iraq you are guilty of the very generalizations you are wishing other people would n't make i do n't mean individuals , i meet a lot of people from the usa that does n't support the war , i see demonstrations and movements popping up i did generalize because i wanted to point out the problem with generalization , which is what people do with islam and muslims
2	yeah i know it still occurs from what people say , etc but i was talking specifically that they are still upset about this event , it just seems a bit ridiculous
2	yeah i know it still occurs from what people say , etc but i was talking specifically that they are still upset about this event , it just seems a bit ridiculous
1	that whole event was odd how did a bunch of nearly illiterate people on the deep afghan countryside find out about a koran burning which had happened just days earlier ? it took the syrian secret service eight months to find & start pushing propaganda about the danish cartoons , but whoever played those afghans was a lot better prepared and informed
6	how else are you supposed to judge a group ? if some individuals act like douches , then hang out with a group of similar people i'm going to assume it is a group of douches do you judge your local police department by the training drills they do as groups , or their actions as individuals ?
4	what has that got to do with it ? because you think a cartoon is harmless , does n't mean everyone else does
2	what a single pastor in the us did behind closed doors also the media there was just no need for that idiot to have any time on television there will always be idiots on this planet and reporting on that particular idiot was not worth eight lives
3	uh hm yes ? destroying a human for such a petty reason seems pretty crazy to me but then again , bla bla bla moral relativism bla bla bla , amirite ?
2	yes , texas is just like new york and ireland , the uk and france are so different and of course all states share common laws , history and government right ? oh wait they do n't , are you like a euro redneck or something ? or just a typical ignorant european who is so arrogant about his ignorance he views it as a strength ?
6	and as you go south in denmark you 'd hear it becoming a lot more german in sound but also a lot more fiendish in its dialect ( southern jutland is one of the bastions of an evil dialect considered horrible by even other jutlanders )
2	what the fuck danish does n't sound even remotely like german
2	true , excuse my attempt at humor i was just thinking how insulted some people would be at being called german
8	that is true , and i would maintain he did nothing which was either wrong or illegal it is not his fault that knuckledraggers respond to freedom of speech by randomly killing innocent civilians the guilt belongs entirely to the knuckledraggers
6	hey man have you heard of that bill guy or glenn beck ? did you miss the post a few days back news stories they have lied about ? etc
2	i disagree in the sense that we should give legitimate news stories like this one page views on fox , and just stay away from the slanted articles the message this would send to fox would be that more people care about news stories , and that they should publish more of them
6	oh my god ftfy , " allah " is the arab word for " god "
1	blasphemy ! ! ! !
4	love the hivemind feed the hivemind enjoy karma
6	what ? ! it was n't nearly as good as the book which also sucked
5	your country would suck , too , if for centuries two continents abused your people for cheap labor and resources
3	ten years is a lot of time for attempted murder you can get ten years for a successful murder here in sweden , i'm sure denmark is not that different are you expecting some ridiculous american <> year prison sentence ?
8	locked in a room , supplied with food , access to tv and gaming consoles ? you 're right it could be worse
4	fyi a " life " sentence in denmark is <> years , that 's the longest amount of time you 'll get locked away here , and that 's the sort of sentence you get if you successfully murder someone
1	here in sweden , people seem to get around <> years in prison for attempted , premediated murder , and that 's when they successfully stab their victim did this axe guy manage to hit someone ?
1	usually i would agree but when the crime has its root in religious fantatiscm with the sole intent to deter others from expressing themselves in ( in denmark ) legal way , then it stops being " just " a crime if that logic would be followed , then <> <> was also " just " a crime hijacking and murder
4	yes that 's all well and good you called him secular and your position was weakened accordingly it was laughable and certainly not fact to anyone who has payed a modicum of attention ( if we 're going to go on demeaning each other ) he had social welfare programs and libya had low poverty rates but he definitely was not secular i never said nato has pure intentions with their involvement in libya i never said there was n't huge problem with wealth disparity in the united states these are things you are prescribing to me because i called you out also , this has nothing to do with the op , which was another indication that you were a bit stark , raving mad at the time it was an oddly placed tirade about the libyan intervention have a good day , sir no hard feelings
2	that question has been asked several times by western media even fucking fox news has discussed this , i believe in fact , i am not sure any one has denied the claims that there are some islamic fundamentalists mixed in with the movement just because you did n't pay enough attention to know this , does n't meant the rest of the world has been depraved of the knowledge yes it is still hard to believe gaddafi was a secular ruler
4	i agree i saw something on tv about canadian prisons and was quite impressed they work with the prisoners , apparently , and try to make them see why what they did was wrong our way of " you get a time out because you 've been naughty " does n't work on adults i think
6	a much more homogenous populations ? ? maybe if you go by skin color , but not if you consider language and culture about the muslims , they are a part of europe and european history the muslims re educated the western world after we forgot everything , but sure , ignore that and guess what , we have ' white ' muslims here and they 've been muslims a long time , it 's not a skin color division you do n't know what you 're talking about
2	europeans have been butchering each other for thousands of years you really think that we are scared of couple of brown people ?
8	haha , you are too clueless to be real
5	i blame the shining , look at what western cultural influences do it clearly worked there so he was just trying to emulate the film
2	i do n't know i think the punishment does n't necessarily have to fit the crime but should be custom catered to the criminal will be vulnerable to militant islamists ( or other militants ) do not care about being locked up staunch ideology is a very difficult to unlearn what 's more , many why not punish him with something that would be terrible to him ? religious zealots are usually homophobic and racist , so line up a bunch of huge gay black dudes to do a train on his ass sorry , i know that 's a very controversial thing to say but i have no respect or care for anyone that tries to silence freedom of press speech and if rehabilitation is more important , we should n't be advocating punishment at all , but rather a method that would rehabilitate all of these idiots by allowing them to live with western families or some such
4	well done nobody should link to fox news , it 's a propaganda outlet , not news
6	i dunno , there is that whole ' innocent until proven guilty ' thing to consider can they prove he actually tried to kill him ? maybe he should have just been charged with breaking and entering plus threatening with a lethal weapon , gotten a couple of years jail time then deported
5	my goodness , you just implicitly condoned censoring the views of non immigrants !
1	<> years for attempted murder is not harsh enough the different between attempted murder and murder should be small in terms of punishment , if the intentions are the same
1	<> years for attempted murder is not harsh enough the different between attempted murder and murder should be small in terms of punishment , if the intentions are the same
8	you can speak because you are a human being do n't think that you can only say something on the basis that " you 're and immigrant " speak because you want to be heard you 've a very valid point , and i really dislike the fact that the statement can be labelled by others as racist
6	netherlands ? are you incapable of reading ?
6	where do you learn this from ? i see nothing about the netherlands in this thread ?
1	you do n't think that the netherlands and denmark is the same , do you ? i was going to say that you are a stupid american , but then i would get a storm of downvotes fuck this , i'm probably going to anyway
6	for the first three months then the novelty of sleeping in a bed , eating unaccustomed food , and watching danish comedies on tv wears off , and he 's just locked up and deprived of his freedom
2	hehe , , actually i 've never in my life met another dane who had a panic room westergaard had one installed since he had recieved more than a hundred death threats and people several times had tried to get their hands on him ahh , , the religion of peace magnifique
2	so we can deny all the lies and editing of videos fox does if they happen to do few things correctly ? every newspaper would wish they could be held to such low standards and obviously muslims are extremists , clearly this man and the thousands of other terrorists and zealots are representatives for billions of people , after all their actions is for the sake of these extremists you 're the reason i ask my self why i still have n't removed this shit form my frontpage , and had it not been for the useful links i would
6	confirmation bias ? the nutjobs get the most attention in any group what christians do you see on the news ? westboro baptist church , or the one with a bunch of old grannies singing old songs ?
8	somali muslims ( i e somalis in general ) as a group do n't tend to paint a great picture of themselves here or abroad disproportionate representation of sexual assaults for example , high unemployment , a lack of integration , drug dealing do n't get me wrong , i'm sure you are a nice person and all , hard working and committed to the liberal western values of finland but a whole group is easily stereotyped when enough members harm the society around them
8	if you open someones abdominal cavity because they call you a coward ? crazy not to be taken seriously or to be respected not fit for society you are n't deep , dude
4	living on the german border and watching german tv did it for me thankfully i cured myself with lots of english books and films
1	he 's not defending islam , you fucking idiot do n't you realize how much of a dick you are to equate islam with " crazy people who tries to kill other people with axes " when there 's several hundred million people into islam ?
6	i guess that was n't directed at me , but at the one i replied to ?
5	i have no idea where you got that from the reason i put " islamic " in quotes was because i was quoting ( almost ) every racist rhetoric that aims to make the word islam synonymous with terrorism , and , as my last sentence clearly suggests , i do not hold that view the acts of an individual do not have any bearing on the character of the ethnic group social class race that he or she belongs to unless this person is acting with the consent of the people in question al qaeda is n't an elected group the muslims do n't elect them therefore , it is n't right to blame islam or muslims for the actions of al qaeda same goes for every " terrorist " attack these people speak for themselves and not for people of their faith , class , nationality etc please read my post again and if i do , anywhere , endorse the idea of blaming all muslims for the actions of a handful of people , i 'll gladly acquiesce and edit it out
2	ah yes , the radical islamists are the same as americans oh wait , that 's bullshit to demonstrate , a quick thought experiment lets say a weapon has been invented that can kill any number of people anywhere , and target accurately any specific individual on earth uses portal technology or something if you gave this to the us , would they wipe out scores of civilians , or use it to target specific individuals who are in the way of their business interests ? now hand that device to any group of violent islamists do you believe they would have any moral qualms against using the device against scores of heretics and unbelievers ? the us wants your money the islamists want to dominate everybody to please their imaginary friend do n't pretend these groups are equivalent
6	oh no , we lack stone age morals ! oh no , the horrors of materialism what a crock
1	now you are just being a douchebag european trying to make it look like americans are all stupid right ?
6	i'm aware i was just playing devil 's advocate if you do n't mind i would like to continue with a couple questions how large of a sample do you need for a group this large ? should n't a group make every effort to disavow the actions of individuals if they are n't representative of the group ? how large of a sample does it take for a disavowal be taken seriously ?
8	every muslim i 've met was a jihadist it can go both ways
1	if a person is a self admitted member of a group then it is only reasonable to expect that person to show traits , beliefs and actions common to said group the problem then becomes knowing what actually are the common traits , beliefs and actions of a certain group if certain vocal minorities within a group show traits , beliefs or actions that are not shared by the majority , then perhaps the majority needs to do a better job of showing that they are indeed different and that they do not silently tolerate such behavior ?
6	i have certainly never mistaken the nationality when its mentioned in the headline , thats for sure
7	and at some points in history have we been influenced by french and german culture , the most common language among the upperclass would at times be either german or french because it was considered more classy
6	has his family talked to him to see what on earth is going on ?
4	problem is , he 'll be hailed as a hero in somalia
4	oh yes , of course i totally agree that he should 've been sentenced to <> years , pending deportation back to somalia where he can live in his ancap , sharia paradise in peace then again , i find it hard to look at the issue so splittingly but that may just be me i cannot , as hard as i try with almost any issue affecting society , see any issue black and white ly for example there 's no doubt that this is a very , very strong minded individual ( a strong mind being one that is resistant to change ) how could he not be , being willing to murder and suffer for his beliefs ? as for respect for the laws of a society he believes that the laws of that society are incorrect , plane and simple i am a bit of a moral objectivist in some regards , but for an individual who has for his entire life only known islamofascism , and an individual who probably came and settled in scandinavia with sabotage firmly in mind , it is hard to write him off as one who is nothing more than an evil , destructive man he 's been affected by his upbringing in a way that i'm sure that many of us ca n't even imagine
7	he 's generally a good willed guy with mutual trust to his neighbors that he would n't expect someone to do something like this otoh , he apparently ran and hid in his panic room
2	sometimes i think it would be an insult to call someone a dane
6	for quite sometime i thought holland and the netherlands were one and the same !
8	its because you 're self centered cunt can you mistake lithuania and latvia ? slovakia and slovenia ? bulgaria and romania ? yemen and oman ? uzbekistan and turkmenistan ? canada and usa ? uruguay and paraguay ? bunch of africans countries ? yeah , you never
8	the comment has been downvoted to oblivion
2	i seriously do n't understand how people can mistake these two countries for one another people from netherlands are dutch and that sounds similar to danish , and they are both fake germans
1	i could actually so fuck you
8	except that 's states , not countries and you 'd be surprised how much people know
2	yeah , because this never happened fox made it all up if you ca n't pick the facts out and leave the rest you must be pretty stupid
4	a wild jew appears he uses bash islam it 's supper effective , as always
1	islam is a gross , fucked up idea why do you defend it ?
2	i , for one , disavow said pornographers
4	really ? if that 's true i'm actually really glad he got <> years ! i was afraid they would be hesitant to sentence him harshly due to fear of extremist backlash justice !
1	don ' t freakin ' link to fox fucking news
1	the faith laughs at your failure ( oh common lighten up a bit people , this guy is fucking retarded )
8	should have gotten <> years in a mental institution so they can unbrainwash this dumbass psycho from all this religious bullshit he 's got running around in his head
8	yes , in <> years he definitely wo n't want to kill anyone that draws the prophet muhammad
1	you 're goddam right i am , wonderful people ! tell you what though , i wait ages to meet up with someone from that side of the family , then four or five show up at the same time
8	yeah , but guttenberg was actually a good politican he lied and has to step down and you can obviously see that german citizens took it in their own hands to bring him dont but he wasnt all that bad
4	actually , fun fact one time , a prankster added an eleventh name to the list it was corrected shortly after , but not before the " spiegel " magazine printed the wrong name as well it was then reintroduced to wikipedia , because now there was a proper source for it
1	could you elaborate on why he was a good politician ? i , for one , think he was a douchebag the way he handled the kunduz affair and saying that people who are against internet filters are for childpornography are just two examples
4	he played a major role in ending germany 's mandatory military service , i do n't really care ( or know about ) his other achievements or shortcomings but i'm very grateful for that alone
2	that 's your proof ? he 's a fraud because some blogger says he is and calls him ' moshe ' ?
2	" reza khalili " is a fraud ( http careandwashingofthebrain blogspot com <> <> can you identify this mossad agent html )
8	campaigners fear the existing post mubarak transition programme which would see september 's ballot held under an amended version of egypt 's existing constitution and then allow members of parliament to oversee the writing of a new constitution may cede permanent power to the muslim brotherhood and other religious groups , who are expected to dominate the pol " i'm not expecting an outright brotherhood victory or the creation of some kind of iranian theocratic state , but clearly if the new parliament does not have adequate representation from the movements that played such a key part in sparking the revolution then that 's a cause for concern " this is worrying i agree that the last sentence might have some truth to it , but you ca n't simply dismiss it as a distraction , certainly not until the egyptians have gone to the polling booths you have to be mindful of coalitions and coalition agreements in the uk , the libdems , the third largest party are now in government with the tories this might occur in egyptian politics i'm not claiming it 's going to be like the taliban , but just that it 's not quite the future everyone was hoping for the truth is neither of us know for sure if the concerns are founded until they 've gone to the polls
1	of course it matters human rights and just treatment of people should be important to us
2	it 's because the " islamists " are backed by the west just like during the iranian revolution , the u s is dying to put a dictator into place that 'll quell any popular resentment of multinational corporations who will come in and strip all the natural resources from the country you know how " political scientists " have all that theory about " democracy " and how this is the " nth wave of democracy " in the middle east ? that 's all propaganda it 's a platform for major european nations and america to export their brand of exploitation to countries they want to take the resources from the same thing is happening in libya , except in reverse the u s did n't like gaddafi , so they took whatever popular resentment they could dig up against him and tried to convert it into a coup d ' etat against his government they lifted the sanctions for oil trading so that the revolutionaries could get rich , sent arms over there , and then bam , the revolutionaries set up a central bank , and already had a u s style mcgovernment in place you still following me there , fukuyama ?
6	i totally see your point , especially from this part of the article but the important part is the use of the words " may cede " , especially when the mb themselves say the brotherhood 's new political vehicle , the freedom and justice party , has vowed not to contest more than <> of parliamentary seats and will not run a candidate for president in an effort to assuage concerns at home and abroad over a potential islamist takeover of the state i guess i tend to agree with wael ghonim " this is a waste of time , " tweeted the pro change campaigner and former google executive wael ghonim , who argued that the constitution debate had descended into an ideological point scoring contest in which neither side was willing to back down if the left was serious about this , they would have started to write a constitution already , right now it 's a lot of people trying to get a piece of the cake while their country is still under military rule !
4	yes it is how much more proof could you possibly ask for ? you have two polls one of them says egypt hates the idea of islamist government , the other one says it loves it the second poll comes from an organization founded by the heirs to one of the largest oil companies on the planet egypt has received <> billion dollars in u s military " aid " ( http www reuters com article <> <> <> us egypt usa aid idustre70s0in20110129 ) while mubarak was dictator , for the last <> years or do you just think all those brown skinned people are savages ? is that your theory ?
1	poll rigging has been going wild for the last few months support for obama has disappeared , support for ron paul is what replaced it the media is dying to cover up this fact literally , dying fox news cannot survive in a free society , nor can msnbc or cnn
6	all i said was that every country should be concerned about human rights and the treatment of people in other countries i did n't say anything about the u s wars why are you conflating the two issues ?
8	yes , when we are talking about egypt , lets bring in the u s war in other nations other than egypt he never said the u s was right , just that egypt is n't exactly a hide out for reasonable non religious people he never said he agreed with our wars nor that they are just or humane stay on topic asshats
7	i sort of agree with one sentence and disagree , strongly , with the next throughout your post , that is i ca n't decide whether to upvote or to downvote ( r firstworldproblems )
7	i hope not i hope the radical right does n't exploit the religious to keep power in their hands by framing the debate of fair representative democracy , that 's been so hard fought for by progressives , to one of gaining power over the masses by claiming moral superiority i hope they " do n't get fooled again " no , no
5	how can you hijack protests ? by winning democratic elections ?
2	exactly , and that was my point , if you read the article carefully you 'll know that the mb has not chance to take over egypt , they will be part of a government just not the majority the mb is used as a distraction from the current military control of the economy
2	you 're right , " terrorism " has replaced " communism " as the constantly changing , deathly horrible enemy that we supposedly need to raise taxes to defend ourselves against but in reality nothing has changed in the system itself in fact the military spending is still growing , despite the global call for peace that ended the cold war i actually have huge reservations about fukuyama the end of history is free market cryptoanarchy , not representative democracy what we call " democracy " is only a path towards the utter destruction of mankind growing income material inequality , militarization of the government against populations , suppression of all dissent , disease for profit , you name it when you give a group of representatives the power to reshape an economy , they will find people to sell the economy to if the people in charge oppose auctioning off the economy , and can be killed in secret , they will be , and always have been above all the bullshit " left right " " communism fascism " theories in political science , that 's the real truth the u s government absolutely wants an " islamist " state in egypt not only does it keep the myth about " primitive muslims " in the public consciousness , it allows the resources to keep flowing , as soon as they find some greedy people to take the reins that 's why the military retained control after mubarak resigned
2	arab spring leaves egypt in an economic slump tourism has dropped , wow i wonder why could it have anything to do with the secret police ( http the classic liberal com hosni mubarak agents provocateur ) mubarak sent around to terrorize his population ? egypt 's political transformation moves slowly because the military is trying to choke the shit out of the country , mubarak stepped down but nobody else in his administration did why do n't you take your head out of the u s media septic tank ( npr is better than msnbc , cnn , and fox , but not that much ) for five minutes , go back to the top of this thread , and read what " petstorehero " wrote ? i just got back from visiting my family in cairo they were shocked when i talked about how american media portrays a " well now what do we do " feeling about what was going on over there on every corner my father was talking about the new shops that had gone up and the growing economy maadi especially , but places like attamayah also and how still <> months after the revolution there is a surging sense of civic pride new shops going up think about america what is the thing that 's always stopping new stores from opening ? zoning laws , health permits , liquor licenses , taxes on businesses the government maybe in some places if you 're unlucky , the police will just come to you and tell you they 're going to shut you down without a bribe who 's going to stop them ? " internal affairs " ? pfft there 's such a crystal clear lesson we could all learn from egypt about what a government actually it is a group that lies about being beneficial for a society , when in reality it 's strangling the society to make itself rich
2	the <> is really fucking annoying , is n't it ?
6	wow i ca n't believe you 're getting upvotes pew are very reputable your arguments do n't make any sense whatsoever they consist entirely of non sequiters ( http en wikipedia org wiki non sequitur ) the lobbying is n't important the question is lobbying in what on explaining the difference between the pew attitudes poll and support for the islamist parties poll ultra conservative attitudes do n't necessarily translate into support for fundamentalist parties this was observed in pew 's pakistan poll a few years ago ( http afpak foreignpolicy com posts <> <> <> pakistan in polling vs pakistan in practice ) the aforementioned findings seem to be contradicted by the reality on the ground pakistani muslims overwhelmingly welcome an islamic influence over the country 's politics , citizens continue to " consistently reject religious parties at the polls " the alliance of islamist parties in pakistan , the mma , was trounced at the <> polls , managing to win only a miserable <> <> percent of the vote the framing of survey questions can help explain contradictory quantitative data in the case of the results generated in pew 's religion , law , and society section of the survey , respondents were asked black and white questions , like , " do you favor or oppose making stoning people who commit adultery the law in pakistan ? " according to moeed yusuf , a south asia advisor at the u s institute of peace , much of the so called " muslim world " find it difficult to go against anything seen as ordained by islam he added , " at an abstract level , islam remains important to even the most secular of muslims remember islam is very candid about state and religion being an integrated whole ( at least in the classic narrative ) and so such questions would elicit such responses " when faced with a choice between what they are supposed to say and what they actually practice , respondents tend to match abstract questions with equally abstract answers you are advised to read the entire article for a good rundown of why the results in egypt might seemingly contradict support for fundamentalist parties in fact , foreign policy 's analysis explains the aberration that only <> of egyptians would vote for the muslim brotherhood but <> want religious leaders in ' advisory roles ' for government not your mish mash of non sequiters
4	the difference between you and me is that i'm dealing with facts and extrapolating from that , and you are simply hoping that what you would wish to happen , happens this article is by a left wing paper and is stating that it seems likely according to liberals that the mb will gain power i'm not sure where your argument is oh and for the last time , i'm pro arab spring i think it 's a good thing they got rid of the despot i'm just a little concerned how it will turn out , as are the liberals in egypt
7	i just got back from visiting my family in cairo they were shocked when i talked about how american media portrays a " well now what do we do " feeling about what was going on over there on every corner my father was talking about the new shops that had gone up and the growing economy maadi especially , but places like attamayah also and how still <> months after the revolution there is a surging sense of civic pride
2	you 've given this a little bit of a spin in the title ( whilst being factually correct ) , focusing on the million strong protest rather than what it 's actually about which is the likelihood that the muslim brotherhood will indeed get into power a fact that most redditors seemed to think would n't happen in a country that holds rather extreme religious views according to pew polls
4	i just got back from visiting my family in cairo they were shocked when i talked about how american media portrays a " well now what do we do " feeling about what was going on over there on every corner my father was talking about the new shops that had gone up and the growing economy maadi especially , but places like attamayah also and how still <> months after the revolution there is a surging sense of civic pride
3	any conventional political movement in arab states will face severe problems from firstly the west headed up by the us and its proxy , israel , and secondly from religious whack jobs created in the main from a reaction to the first problem
2	great news i felt really uncomfortable with how prominent the muslim brotherhood was in the protests this revolution is for the people , not for islam
1	i have a bad feeling egyptians will soon have me making a u turn and wishing they were still being oppressed rather than have to deal with yet another theocratic and or religious looney bin like iran , pakistan , saudi etc
3	then why are the liberals in egypt so worried ? political voting systems rarely require a clear majority to take power
6	the last paragraph of the article is actually the most interesting part some activists though have labelled the entire row an unnecessary distraction from the more important job of formulating new policies that tackle egypt 's many socio economic problems and improve the condition of over <> million egyptians still living below the poverty line " this is a waste of time , " tweeted the pro change campaigner and former google executive wael ghonim , who argued that the constitution debate had descended into an ideological point scoring contest in which neither side was willing to back down love the use of the words " some activists " , this really reinforces how unimportant these people are , therefore why should anyone care what they have to say
2	oh man , it feels like only yesterday that reddit furiously attacked anyone who dared suggest that there was a chance this revolution would put the mb in power in some way egypt was gonna be a big san fransisco with bike lanes and priuses and hippie jambands (
1	you mean the ' left ' that used to be the harbinger of all evil and terror in the world ? that left , the one that was vilified as the most nefarious ideology on earth ? my enemy 's enemy
1	that does n't make sense ! ! ! islam is the most peaceful , loving , tolerant , religion furthermore , muslims in egypt have never ever engaged in any acts of violence or wide spread systematic discrimination against non muslim egyptians in the entire history of the country if there should be any religion involved in the egyptian government its definitely islam ! ! silly egyptians
4	i quoted the poll , but i have to admit that 's a good bit of digging , and the bias of a source should always be taken into consideration
2	there have been a lot of crackdowns by the army and accusations of gross human rights violations what can you tell me about that ?
1	sensationalist , agenda driven , american media at its best they are attempting to portray any act of civil uprising as being a " bad idea " in the end they need to keep americans complacent
1	really ? would you consider npr in this fashion ? i 've never known them to be sensationalist or agenda driven and despite petstorehero 's anecdotal evidence , here are some recent articles from them that do n't give such a rosy picture arab spring leaves egypt in an economic slump ( http www npr org <> <> <> <> arab spring leaves egypt in an economic slump ) egypt 's political transformation moves slowly ( http www npr org <> <> <> <> arab spring leaves egypt in an economic slump ) and npr does good reporting , so i'm inclined to believe them over a single account but i'm open to reading any well sourced articles that say otherwise
6	the global paradigm has shifted were not fighting the rooskies anymore secular states are the most important interest to the us democratic or not the us wanting an islamist state is absurd edit fukayama is brilliant
6	i'm guessing it 's equivalent to foreigners thinking that children in america are being subjected to sexually invasive searches by tsa agents all over the us
2	well , a lot of americans associate " christianity " with " virtue " and " love " and so forth the rest of them are either moronic christians that associate it with war and so forth ( <> , maybe less now ) , or people that associate it with the crusades , catholic priest child molestation , and imperialism ( " atheists " ) not to mention members of other religions in the u s but the extent to which we believe " christianity " should affect government or just " religion " in government is a very very vague question , just like you say i think politicians , if they 're doing anything at all , should put goodwill and compassion into it , but irrationality is a whole different question the same thing is true there people associate islam with peace that 's why you always hear people saying , " islam is a religion of peace , " even if there are passages in the koran that say things like " you go to heaven if you die defending the faith , " and the more extreme ones ( not coming to mind right now ) there are passages like that in the bible too , especially in the old testament i do n't know if i would vouch for the numbers they give in that npr piece , though <> for atheists seems very low pew says <> <> http www freethoughtpedia com wiki percentage of atheists atheists in america but we 've already talked about why pew is not trustable at all in this thread this one says <> http topics nytimes com top reference timestopics subjects a atheism index html ? inline nyt classifier but on an issue by issue breakdown , you really get to the meat of the question
5	there were lots of discussions about the recent rape tests that were given to a group of women , in the same manner that we might discuss the most recent political sex scandal i can say that there is not a sense of fear among the general public , or if there is the excitement far outweighs the trepidation
4	ah so it 's a sinister conspiracy , is it ? good to know
3	strange that there 's such a big disparity between our polls , huh ? something 's off here i'm so used to rigged polling organizations i started looking up pew the first thing i noticed is that the " pew charitable trusts " have <> billion dollars in assets , and are spending <> <> of that money on lobbying efforts https secure wikimedia org wikipedia en wiki pew charitable trusts the only lead i got was to this webpage http www discoverthenetworks org funderprofile asp ? fndid <> which is broken , as you can see so i went to the google cache of it ( here 's a copy ) http hpaste org <> and found out that the pews who started the foundation were the heirs to , you guessed it , sunoco oil http everything explained at sunoco alarm bells should be going off in your head at this point why would a polling foundation founded by the heirs to an oil company spend <> <> of its money on lobbying ? or any of its money on lobbying ? and why would it also lie about the source and nature of political instability in egypt , an oil and gas rich country ? i do n't know oil ? maybe gas , too ? http www biggamefishingjournal com pew hutch article html everything in this country unravels if you look at it closely enough everything sunoco , as you can see from the " everything explained " link , has purchased the rights to mobil and is the official fuel of nascar the article also notes researchers at the university of massachusetts amherst have identified sunoco as the <> largest corporate producer of air pollution in the united states , with roughly <> <> million pounds of toxic chemicals released annually into the air <> major pollutants indicated by the study include nickel compounds , naphthalene , aniline , and benzene

1	this is just too much does anyone seriously believe this was just an ' accident ' ?
5	oh , the other people and the crew ? yeah , that 's tragic i thought you meant that the death of techs who were helping the oppressive dictatorship in iran to get nukes was tragic
8	of course , this was almost certainly an accident ( as there is no evidence at all to suggest sabotage ) but if it were an assassination , it can hardly be said to be carried out by people who do n't care about the lives of anyone who is not like them the <> scientists were using knowledge they had to give a known madman and violent murderer of civilians of his own country the power to threaten , oppress and kill many more the death of others aboard the plane is tragic , the death of these five men is the silver lining to the tragedy

2	this is one stupid conspiracy theory there were even survivors who would leave survivors ? ? ?
1	first of all scientists do n't help with " secrets " it is a secret if it is unknown to the public this is known to the public not sure what the fuck you 're talking about dailymail why you use such weird wording ? next , why the fuck would there be a conspiracy involing russia ? these are some very well educated scientists losing them is a problem for russia ( and iran as well ) , even the article makes this point please stop tinfoiling your head and stop with the ridiculous conspiracy theories that make no sense i will concede that if anyone , the israelis would be the most likely assassins in this , though even that , is a jump

1	trend slave posers ? dude you could be slightly retarded , how is spelling a word a cry for attention fuckin ' hipster
6	i know ! your excitement about the death of the russian scientists is perfectly understandable you got such a zionist rush from the headline that you typed your comment before the reading article this is only normal in israel

2	i'm from germany and this is just bullshit germany gave up the d mark for the euro and is the strongest supporter of the whole one europe idea but it does not work if germany pays for all the mistakes and mismanagement of some eu members so what 's the solution , pay until the whole eu goes down or find ways to reorganize the " bad apples " ?
2	yep , every time that the germans act in their own interests , or try to prevent others from ripping them off , they are nazis you heard it here first

2	i agree , this article is bullshit the cover of der spiegel is , as all magazines do , an exaggeration of a topic the arcticle is written very subjective and gives very few actual sources , except its own interpretation of the article in der spiegel the fact is that the germans wanted to put an end to the nightmare of countries that are unable to help them along their imperial path wow just wow care to explain , were that " fact " is coming from ? the end of the article is almost hate mongering against germany

5	i 've read that among reservist troops , and a lot of soldiers not manning the dmz fortifications , malnutrition is becoming increasingly common
1	they are not , at least not the ones that are guarding the border according to the documentary " yoduk stories " , the guards of the border can easily cross , but they do n't want to for several reasons first of all , their families will most likely suffer , and get thrown in to the concentration camps killed , tortured , idk second , they are most likely fed well , and kept happy by the government
7	this is n't really news there is a book out called nothing to envy by barbara demick which chronicles the stories of six individuals as they live their lives through a fairly " decent " north korean period and into the period of " decline " that occurred after the death of kim il sung and during the famine that ravaged the country i use the terms " decent " and " decline " because the situation in korea was n't always this terrible people used to have food now , they do not there was one passage in the book that really struck me a bunch of women actually started up makeshift markets trying to avoid embarrassment by admitting that he could n't feed his people , kim jong il kind of ignored their presence and did n't crack down on them various things were sold in these markets , but as times got worse , rumors of human flesh began to appear the woman in the book was having a discussion with another woman who had claimed to have eaten human flesh he summation was that " if you did n't know what it was , you would swear that it was beef or pork "
6	when did cannibalism ever leave dprk ?
2	great documentary on n korea called " state of mind " i believe

4	mmm , i was being facetious ( fecetious ? ) , though it would n't surprise me if they had to feed that kind of offal to their animals
2	i'm not surprised either while <> documented cases might not seem like a lot to some , that does n't change the fact that these people are so desperate for food that they 're willing to risk having their entire family thrown into labor camps
6	so why did they use a picture of a food truck from los angeles ?
4	eating skinny n koreans would suck i guess it 's a nice change from rice every now and then
1	one case of cannibalism and you can draw the conclusion that they are now fucking eating other people to survive ? hilarious propaganda against communism as usual let 's face it , majority of the people who have died in places like cuba , iraq , iran and n korea over the years due to poverty could be directly attributed to the economic sanctions placed on them
6	so why did they use a picture of a food truck from los angeles ?
2	as someone outside the us , i can honestly say that i hate hulu (
2	yeah , it 's a state run tour guides hover over you and take you only to preplanned locations visitors never get to see the real north korea you are the type of ignorant audience member that the vice guide panders to
2	ironically addressed in max brooks ' world war z the entire population of north korea disappears entirely , presumably into underground shelters nobody is willing to go looking for them because a ) they left behind more than a few booby traps , and b ) zombies might have gotten into the shelters and they 'd be risking letting a few million zombies back into the world
4	all of those are excellent reads i highly suggest them as well
6	hmmm , a country that allows its infrastructure to fall apart , turns a blind eye to ever increasing poverty and desperation , conducts widespread and unaccountable surveillance of its entire citizenry , sees nothing wrong with having a massive prison population held on ever weaker pretenses , run by a ruling class wholly insulated against the negative effects , all while funneling ever increasing amounts of national treasure into a military that vastly outstrips any rational need , and whose existence is justified by dishonest caricatures of an insidious external " enemy " that in reality exists largely only in response to the nation 's own violent antics and is actually unable or unwilling to inflict real harm why does that sound so familiar ?
4	yup but look on the bright side , a few generations of this and the immunities the surviving koreans have will prove useful in developing treatments and cures to prion diseases
2	believe it or not , there are plenty of sources within north korea that can and will leak things like this to the south this is nothing compared to some of the information coming out of north korea , which is far more damaging than mere cannibalism

4	wow i 've never seen it expressed that way , but the parallels are striking
2	exactly that 's why more people do n't leave if you escape they 'll kill your whole family if you try to escape with your whole family , you 're more likely to get caught also there is extended family
2	seems their infrastructure is a million miles away from being able to support that kind of fuck up i mean , i do n't know if arable crops can suck up bad prions from the soil , but i doubt that the people who can afford to eat offal are the ones selling their shit
4	eel is actually very tasty

2	what percentage of rapes around the world go undocumented ? cannibalism is arguably the most heinous and taboo activity that a human can engage in , which makes it that much more difficult to document

2	are you kidding me ? north korea runs organized tours for foreign visitors there are almost no restrictions on americans who wish to join a tour of north korea there are a few us travel agencies you can go through to get on a tour the vice guide people either did no research and blindly went to asia or deliberately deceived their audience to attempt to uphold some notion that n korea is impossible to get into their film shows all the locations that the preplanned state tour hits all they saw was the same facade and stupid shows that every other foreign visitor gets to see they just added idiotic commentary
1	seriously i could n't get past all the fucking ads
4	flawless joke
8	i agree north korea has always had far more in terms of material resources south korea 's most important resource is , and always has been , the intelligence , diligence , and determination her people is still do n't understand how you went from this t he economic divergence from south korea was immediately felt after the korean war to my point is it took less than a generation for nk to go from economically viable to communistic destitution immediately one generation ? or am i misreading you original post ?
2	north korea is one of the hardest countries to enter in the world as a foreigner yet you , from your computer chair , are absolutely certain that the people who actually had access are incorrect i had to stop myself from rolling my eyes because the force generated from this gem of a concept might have blinded me permanently
3	i think it was more a response of fear rather than worship of the great leader
7	i ca n't help but notice the striking similarities to religious types , particularly american christians , who do the exact same thing some doctor or rescue worker works for hours or days to help them , and all they can do is thank the omniscient , omnipotent deity who , according to their dogma , knowingly let them get into the situation in the first place
4	good thing our doctors get paid for it
6	seriously ? you 're joking about forced cannibalism ? that comment was in pretty poor taste
2	not as much as you 'd think i remember an amazing picture by a foreign visitor where soldiers hastily tried to line up in front of a farm tractor , but they were n't fast enough to completely cover up the un logo on the tractor
6	not sure why you 're getting so much hate , that documentary was mediocre at best there are better documentaries out there to recommend to people other than the vice guide
2	yeah it s overrated , reddit loves it though
2	what percentage of rapes around the world go undocumented ? you do realize <> cases of cannibalism is a lowball figure of what is actually going on cannibalism is arguably the most heinous and taboo activity that a human can engage in , which makes it that much more difficult to document
6	eh ? are you asking about eating spoiled meat or are you under the impression that humans are inherently poisonous ?
8	cannibalism is a reality when there is absolutely no other choice " hilarious propaganda " makes me want to facepalm at how little you know about the realities of the world outside of your comfortable room
6	is it just me , or should the title of this post be cannibalism comes to north korea ? question mark included ?
6	a leaked official police document reportedly details at least one case of cannibalism come on
1	this situation is so fucking ridiculous but kim keeps the army fed ( at least a little ) so that they do n't rebel against him so fucking sad there 's going to be nobody left to fuel kim 's impotent rage soon , between the desertions and all the deaths ( from disease , hunger , and " death by state " )
2	so mindless obedience and eats human flesh , all they need is some crocodile and we could shoot a low budget zombie movie
1	fuck you kim
6	at this point how much foreign aid has kim jong il turned away just for the sake of maintaining his self image ?
6	really offtopic , but why murphy ?
2	no first hand personal experience but i can guarantee you that the level of misery in north korea is on par with the worst in the world ( worse than haitan mud cookies ) and the economic divergence from south korea was immediately felt after the korean war the vice guide to north korea , which gives a glimpse of north korea , scratches the surface of how terrible conditions are outside of its major cities i know of female relatives who visited their kins in north korea ( pre tsa ) they smuggled money through their dusty vaginas
6	whoosh !
6	yikes !

2	<> criminal cases of those <> cases of cannabalism this disturbing weird ass country is turning eating other people ! ! ! i'm sure there is widespread hunger but how this article can claim that there is extensive cannabalism from a few cases is baffling what people think they know about this country is disturbing because n korea is so closed off and so little is known about the country , people fill in the blanks with their own ideas it 's our stupidly primitive and innate drive to be curious about the unknown just how people create ghosts and monsters to compensate for the mysterious also , i hope people understand that those videos of little n korean kids playing guitar and n korean girls in a band are simply an extreme facade put on by a ultra paranoid country think about some of the most self conscious people you know and how they come off with strange perfection and blunted affects
1	fuck that website
1	it would be more akin to saying fuck you smith , therefore insulting a hell lot of people named smith

2	very true when they ran out of food supplies in some areas , they ate their pets and livestock when those ran out they turned to insects when insects were n't enough , they turned to tree bark and grass when the land was stripped bare , they turned to the neighbors under the loving care of the fatherly leader ( http www amazon com under loving care fatherly leader dp <> ) details some of this to see the mindset of the average korean , although with a bit of a different thesis than the previous book , i recommend the cleanest race ( http www amazon com cleanest race koreans themselves matters dp <> ) by b r myers ( http www youtube com watch ? v xxpksdshnk0 ) i 've yet to read the aquariums of pyongyang but am getting around to it

6	globalpost is strange like that
6	would you rather see a picture of some guy eating some other guy ?
2	once again american sanctions do their job good job americans , look at what you 're doing to more innocent people
8	oh anonymous ! do n't let us down ! i'm afraid of you , but you give me hope
1	what ? ? ? no better than the nazis ? i would be an ass too if <> million of my people were slaughtered
6	you 're joking , right ?
4	while that 's true , you do have the choice of using or not using apple products personally , i prefer google products although i should mention at the time being i do n't own a cellphone google voice is great
6	while that 's true , you do have the choice of using or not using apple products yes , it 's why i do n't buy apple products even though some of them are otherwise very nice devices
8	i grew up through the sixties , seventies , eighties etc i started off with a great respect for the israeli people but as the year progressed that respect turned to loathing , they are no better than the nazi that oppressed them no matter what is said or done , they think they have a right to dictate to everyone , and the brit and us gov 's are their lapdogs when are they going to accept that being anti israeli is not the same as being anti semitic , and that they have no rights to " special " treatment ?
6	do you realize the app promotes genocide ?
6	do you realize the app promotes genocide ? ? ? ? ?
3	apple offends me as well that level of control over someone else 's device is scary at least if google removes something you can get it from someone else without having to hack into your phone
6	do you realize isreal promotes genocide ?
3	can you provide a link the apple store app with all of those mohammed cartoons , or are you just trolling ? i would guess that apple tries to play it safe and pulls all offensive apps from their app store , regardless of the " offended " population
4	congratulations , you are about as intelligent as a genital wart
3	no better than the nazis ? there goes your credibility of course ignore the peace offers , the fact that their military 's militant civilian kill ratio is <> <> , and that the main people they are fighting against are anti semitic terrorist organizations like hamas do n't ever compare israel to the nazis , it makes you look dumb
1	how the hell is this news ? ! not sure what it 's like in <> , but back in <> someone was shot dead every half an hour in rio anyone who has <> minutes spare , watch this http www youtube com watch ? v lnv mquh ao

2	ahmadinejad is still too moderate toward the us the religious elders think , i feel they are the guys really pulling the strings
2	some men just want to see the doggy 's urn
4	do n't get on this sinking ship its a joke so bad not even birthday sympathy can right it
4	lol
8	i'm not serious all of the time , and i have a very dark sense of humor , but i just ca n't imagine anyone finding this funny
4	perhaps it is my long exposure to anime that allows me to visualize such events in an amusing way i have long ago noticed that some events portrayed in some of my favourite anime would be not at all funny if it were written or portrayed via actors or , perhaps it is simply my perspective and the fact that i am not making the effort to empathize or construct anything but the vaguest of visualizations i mentioned jokingly replacing this event with my wife and my cat i found it funny because it is not within the realm of the possible , and the visualization does not capture the horror such an event would have if carried out in front of me those who are amused alongside myself are probably not making the effort to see beyond the initial absurdity i have gone through enough personal trauma recently ( friend had a miscarriage yesterday ) to not wish to take on more emotional burden , thank you pseudo psychological babble

2	oh yes , that 's it shit that happens is totally justified just because shit happens we should n't be upset by it , just because shit happens and you should be used to it nothing will ever change , move on , shit happens blahblah get the point in my view my very own which i do not care if anyone else shares or adopts treating animals like shit , without reason , is evidence of such cruelty that it shreds the offender of their basic humanity the same with children how dare you take the life of or otherwise abuse something totally innocent ? just because you are fundamentally flawed , without compassion or conscience like a beast who knows not any better you attempt to spin this as if i care nothing about human suffering in the world it 's not that it 's just that it is n't the topic i'm on human interaction on societal levels is wildly more complexed than one person a cruel , angry beast killing a <> pound domestic dog for no fucking reason other than his flawed , feeble mind
4	appreciate the intelligent response , thanks
2	how dare you take the life of or otherwise abuse something totally innocent ? i do n't believe i did just because you are fundamentally flawed , without compassion or conscience like a beast who knows not any better drama much ? you attempt to spin this as if i care nothing about human suffering in the world incorrect i am calling you an emotionally brittle fucktard for getting so upset about a news story there are far worse stories out there you should probably avoid reading them
6	how interesting that you have measured how " upset " i am on my behalf i was speaking my opinion you started started bitching at me , and now i'm fucking saying what i feel like right back i do n't need to grow a pair i'm not fucking whining i say what i feel when i feel it i feel like this guy deserves to be strung up , and i feel like you are a fucking prick for trying to tell me how i should think or feel i'm not into drama , but i do n't let people put words or feelings out there for me , just so they can feel self important on the internet go gripe at someone else , perhaps someone who actually gives a shit what your unsolicited opinion is
6	how interesting that you have measured how " upset " i am on my behalf http www abcteach com directory reading comprehension i feel like this guy deserves to be strung up fair enough i'm not into drama in your original comment you said you were disgusted by humanity , like every single human being was guilty of this crime that seems a bit dramatic to me go gripe at someone else , perhaps someone who actually gives a shit what your unsolicited opinion is unsolicited opinion ? lol , welcome to reddit comments
1	oh , i'm still disgusted by many aspects of humanity let me clarify that for you , since your willingness to be literal has affected your reading comprehension ( thanks for the link , btw i'm sure someone will find it useful ) google this hyperbole i see what you 're trying to do there , but there 's a baseless assumption that i must be upset to think he should be hung out to dry i could give a fuck less about this individual , he 's just one more who deserves it i guess this part could be effectively segued into a treatise on the flawed human condition , but the fact is , i posted a quick message saying this is n't funny to point out how fucked up it is you came along and made a big fucking deal , trying to correct my train of thought for no reason i 've been a little listless lately , so in some trollish way i have enjoyed bitching at you for bitching at me unfortunately , i'm tired of it now not because you have " won " though , so do n't get it twisted we have reached an impasse , and it 's too trivial to go on
2	humanity deserves the shit that runs rampant through it because of our flaws thanks to free will animals are innocent wholly innocent mock all you want , but people who fuck with animals are the lowest of the low to me i do not care if you agree or not
6	well , if you would have seen this woman , you 'd have seen that not only were her tits great , but she had a great pyrenees
6	why why am i laughing ?
2	beating your wife with a dog isnt normal but on meth it is meth not even once
4	this guy is my new favorite hero
2	it 's a dog beat dog world out there
6	like a boss !
1	i guess she got puts on glasses bitch slapped
4	well i thought it was funny
6	would you use a dog to beat your wife ? no , a brick that guy just made literature come to life and proof the differ
2	you mean " tried to kill two bitches with one bitch "
2	beat the shih tzu out of them left that bitch in a poodle of blood
1	i agree there is nothing funny about this at all it 's fucking disgusting
3	he mad ( http media tumblr com tumblr lm3h3muoml1qzozj1 jpg )
0	this belongs in the wtf reddit
1	what the fuck
4	i love my dog , but this headline made me chuckle for some reason
2	this is probably the most hardcore possible way to call your wife a bitch by smacking her with one
2	i hope there was n't a poodle of blood afterwards
1	fuck everyone in this thread that it 's laughing at some dumbshit motherfucker who killed an inocent animal
3	miniature poodle a full sized poodle would have messed up the wife a hell of a lot more
1	hahaha taht caught me off guard lul z have been had and it was a fucking poodle nonetheless , no one cares about those annyoing fucks
8	man , why would you start hitting your poor dog with that thing you call your wife
1	seriously , what the fuck is going on here ?
8	animals are innocent wholly innocent as opposed to who ? the africans that get shot or hacked to death with machetes because they live in the wrong village ? the people who get blown up by terrorists because they do n't believe in allah ? the store clerk who gets his head blown off because some crack head wants to steal <> ? the thousands of people who die every day because they have no food ? this shit goes on all , the , fucking , time life does n't owe you or anyone else a cookie being innocent is no safeguard against batshit insane cruelty grow a pair man it sucks that the dog was abused like that but move on
1	hahaha taht caught me off guard lul z have been had and it was a fucking poodle nonetheless , no one cares about those annyoing fucks
1	fucking scab when it comes time , i hope this man 's death is excruciatingly slow and painful i did n't think it was possible for me to be more disgusted by humanity than i was previously , but it is fuck him , everyone like him , and everyone who finds humor in this
7	the " quick mental picture " of an animal being killed has no initial meaning to me beyond the trust shattering suffering and subsequent death of an innocent , loyal pet on what planet is the image of a dog dying funny before it is sad ?
1	what the fuck ? who beats their wife with a dog ?
2	i could see how hitting her with a poodle would have left that bichon her ass
4	this is the funniest story i 've ever heard and i love dogs ! but still it 's hilarious maybe i'm just really really faded right now that , and it 's funny
8	whether it is funny or disgusting depends on whether you allow yourself to empathize those who read the title , form a quick mental picture ( possibly substituted with their own pets and loved ones ) , and move on will find it funny those who read the article and think beyond the initial mental picture will realize the horror the wife is going through and not find it funny that said , i am one of the former , and joked with my wife about beating her with our cat i am generally not interested in mundane stories , and am most certainly not going to read up on the domestic disputes of an unknown couple in brazil i was , however , attracted by the absurdity of the situation described in the title i agree that this belongs in r wtf rather than r worldnews
4	me too haha , it is completely morbid but how can you not laugh a bit
2	it 's dark humor the image of a person beating another with a something uncommonly used as a weapon like a dog can be funny to some because of its absurdity people need to stop being so serious all the time
6	have you ever been so mad you swung a poodle ?
4	because it ' s funny
1	how the fuck can you laugh at it ? i do n't see any humor in this at all
6	you know , i'm not a big fan of the death penalty , but if its just for bankers , ceo 's and politicians i'm all for it
1	mswati iii can do what he wants and i doubt any article is going to change that true story he once wanted to ' buy ' my mother who was already married to my father for three cows when we lived there for three years fucking swahili polygamists !
6	in swaziland , where coca cola contributes over <> per cent of the country s gross domestic product that 's just crazy !
4	good for them , everyone loves hot cocoa !
2	bullshit al qaeda <> is still allah may they continue to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat the u s
1	yeah , that 's exactly what a terrorist organization needs more of , more religious influence
2	oh c ' mon who writes this garbage ? seriously ap can you tone down the propaganda just a little so he wants to repair rebrand al qaida the most recognised <> arabic words in the world because they are killing too many muslims ? ! ? what , and the us israeli alliance is n't ? ! ? who do they expect will swallow this bullshit !
6	what will happen if the euro collapses ? , countries will go back to their pre euro currency ?
3	worrying that they do n't know this already
4	i was thinking the same thing both britain and the euro members should be rejoicing that you all never joined i was never a euro skeptic but it 's clear i should have been the skeptics were right from the beginning
6	why is timoleon being downvoted ? his post adds context , is factually correct and he even gives his source
6	seems reasonable to this outsider , but please correct me if i'm wrong did n't britain fight tooth and nail to stay out of the euro ? why should it suffer along with other countries that were n't as prudent ?
8	seems reasonable we are still a little pissed ireland is being hung out to dry while everyone runs around to save a country that does n't want to save itself the ecb vetoed us when we asked for ireland to be allowed to default i'm not sure we should do them any favours
2	when the euro crashes and the continent slips into recession , its not going to be spain or greece rioting in the streets it 's going to be the germans who have coddled this supranational disaster from the start
2	we are still a little pissed , you mean you are still drunk ?
1	we are still a little pissed ireland is being hung out to dry that 's not true ! ireland is part of the eu rescue package and gets money from it the ecb vetoed us when we asked for ireland to be allowed to default i'm not sure we should do them any favours of course they do n't allow you to default the whole bail out rescue package is about not letting the countries default and believe me you do n't want to default ! a default does n't mean a fresh start ! it means that you wo n't get any money on the open market at all !
2	i accept your unconditional and cowardly surrender off you go
1	in prison communities there 's a lot more gay partnerings than gays i think that 's called rape , but whatever melts your butter kid
6	what are you babbling ? teaching kids that , " when you have sex with someone , you automatically get whatever disease they have and any disease anyone they 've had sex with had " is n't about aids and homosexuality , it is about scaring people about the dangers of all stis stis are a serious health problem , and it is true in a sense that when you have sex with someone , you can catch whatever sti they have , which they got from previous partners while one can question the legitimacy of trying to scare kids instead of just teaching them the facts , it is n't about being politically correct about aids and homosexuality
4	thank you this is what i was trying to say
8	understood what a devastating way to contract hiv not to say that it 's not all unfortunate , but damn
3	i read claims that it 's well over <> times higher , the risk that is , than what this article quotes ( <> times ) i do n't know if it matters much , since the general consensus should be that it goes with a much greater risk
2	so a man can have sex with another but they are not gay or bisexual apart from rape how does this work so a person who rapes cats is not into beastiallity as long as they say so , no matter how many cats they rape
6	actually , the highest infection rates are in men who have sex with men ( msm ) , ok i'm with you this far who do n't necessarily identify as gay or bisexual lol whether they " identify " being gay or not , they are gay being in denial does n't make them straight they do n't get to choose or " identify " what they are i think your love of over catagorization and worthless acronyms is clouding your thinking this also seems like a convenient means for the gay community to disown the problem of hiv transmission and blame straight people , as they so often like to do
4	i'm glad i was able to teach you something
2	anal sex is seen as a cultural loophole
3	duby presented the findings of her study , which interviewed almost <> people in tanzania , uganda and kenya i just want to point out this statement is meant to apply to people in these areas as a heterosexual i clicked the link expecting to find an article claiming my middle school education was wrong , and that anal sex was somehow not more dangerous i imagine that these statistics would be quite different in other regions of the world
6	we should start a rumor that sex with a condom does n't count ( and it would almost be true ) then the cultural loophole would be the condom tada !
1	the first symptom of hiv is a pounding sensation in your asshole
2	always where a condom ! is it really that hard ?
6	the other people who replied to your comment are missing the obvious male male sex homosexual sex gay heterosexual people do no have homosexual intercourse , by definition edit to the people downvoting this why do n't you break out a dictionary and look up the definitions of these words
2	anal sex is shitty
4	ah , thanks for the information i actually meant the rate of occurrence for new infections , which is slightly different than transmission rate though have n't blood transfusion transmissions been cut down to almost zero in the us ? maybe the data on the wiki page is from worldwide information
8	that 's exactly what it 's for and personally , i despise it it 's become a very difficult psychological challenge for me as an adult
2	that really is n't true there 's a big difference between behavior and identity refusing to acknowledge the fact that there are plenty of men who have had risky sex with other men who are not gay and go on to have risky sex with women or other men in the future is to cabin the scope of our consideration of the hiv problem and denounce responsibility if it 's just seen as " their " problem , mainstream communities feel entitled to shirk their duties to practice safer sex
8	i think you missed the point of my reply and i ca n't tell if you 're trolling or earnestly believe what you espouse so i 'll just let you stew bless your heart
7	even if the msms were actually gay , one reason i can think of why they do n't identify is because society , as you do , looks down on the lgbt community , particularly cultures of machismo and btw , as a member of the gay community no , i do n't " disown " the problem of hiv transmission it 's a huge public health concern within my community that i 'd like to ameliorate try not to overthink it try to think k thx bye
1	oh no , my precious karma points i was gonna buy a new espresso machine with those , and now they 're all gone shit this is terrible i 'll never make another controversial post again , evaar ! fuck all of youse ! cunts gimme back my karma points , or i 'll rape a puppy !
6	he asked why you should n't do it , not whether it had been done before
8	so when the germans tried to starve the entire netherlands , that does n't qualify ? or enslaved a significant portion of the polish population ? all those people who were in the " targeted " groups were europeans belonging to individual nations first and foremost what happened on both sides is that people let this happen to other people because it was n't happening to them no nation got involved in wwii out of a sense of justice or violated ethics they got involved because of political and economic reasons if you actually look at the historical documents of them time , you 'll find that the moral justification bit only got invented after the war
8	unfortunately , in another part of the world , a horrible event like srebrenica massacre ( http en wikipedia org wiki srebrenica massacre ) happened shortly after i'm skeptic whether a lot of people aware of it
6	of course you know why that is this country is so cravenly pc , and terrified of being accused of racism , that unless a crime is perpetrated by a european , you cannot call attention to it if the same situation had been the scots slaughtering the welsh , the us would have been all over it and calling it genocide but , since the monsters in this case were african crickets
6	because raiding pension plans , running pyramid scheme scams , and bilking millions of people out of millions of their hard earned dollars is n't destructive gosh , those rich white people why ca n't everyone be more like them ?
6	why not ? let 's say you 're the member of a formerly enslaved group you somehow gain your freedom the oppressors come back and there is no ability to negotiate or compromise let 's also say that every member of this group constitutes a current or future threat what do you do ?
8	yes , sadly unthinkable human rights tragedies are happening right now all over the world well documented and well known that 's why the news gets to me so much coverage of sensationalized bs and " filler " news on the other hand i think if people were forced to watch the really important stuff <> <> they could n't handle how bad it really is and would simply tune out
8	no genocide has happened since rwanda what you mention are not genocide , they are massacres there was no intent in any of your examples of a willingness to destroy all members of the opposing side that said , if it would start again somewhere in africa , i am convinced the lack of reaction would be the same do n't forget , the rwandese genocide lasted only <> days during which about <> ' <> people were massacred ( that 's <> dead day , <> hour , <> <> minute ! ! ! ) but i agree with your second paragraph
3	i do n't understand why this woman would order a rape i could understand the rapists doing it , as horrible as that is , and i could understand ordering genocide , as horrible as that is , but what does ordering a rape accomplish , even in the mind of a bigoted , murderous , genocidal maniac ?
5	probably should n't have raped and genocided
1	fuck yr christ
6	lol tutsi but for real , i know some tutsi refuges from burundi , their baby son was poisoned in their refuge camp for being a tutsi or something like that it 's been awhile
4	thanks for that the man deserves to be known by name related please consider doing an ama on your time in rwanda
6	if only women ruled the world , there would be no reads article , oh never mind
3	<> year trial ? ! horrible i hope she rots
2	i can see how you think that civil war such as this has little to do with a state 's liberalism , but show me a democratic state with strong property rights and i 'll show you a state free of genocide hand in hand is exactly it edit to include the standard caveats that colonialism ruined any chance african countries have at installing such a regime today , & c not arguing that point
1	or armenians , or congolese pygmies , or people of an ' incorrect ' political orientation in argentina , chile , or the ussr , or anyone they 're not specifically told to care about fuck , now i need a drink
6	at least you tried , when you were in a position to try dont feel bad
1	should n't all modern nations be as accountable as the u s in this case ? or am i misinformed and america is the only country not doing everything to help ? i agree that these nations need aid to help prevent such atrocities , but i almost never hear " when will the denmark stop the horrible events in genocidia ? ! "
4	yeah i recognize that i'm still leary of that whole mess , honestly as another comment mentions , it 's not cut and dry really screwed up situation over there shame , too , becuase rwandans are some of the best people i 've ever had the pleasure of meeting
5	come on , let 's be fair here the reason the holocaust happened while the world watched is because the world ( for the most part ) simply do n't care about jews ftfy , and for the most part , yes , i 'd agree with that statement there are numerous critiques of america 's late entrance into the war that are centered on this fact the saddest thing is that nobody ever decided to intervene in rwanda , and rwanda happened after we all supposedly learned our lesson about genocide and how horrible it is
2	the average person has little reason to care about the mass murder and genocide of an ethnic group ? of the systematic murder of <> <> <> , <> , <> human beings ?
6	poor on poor crime more like it you do n't see ghetto thugs hunting down rich black folk just to take them down a notch , do you ?
7	so true before the white man came to africa , it was a peaceful , civilized , egalatarian utopia
4	i did n't this was way more interesting than amusing rage comics
2	typical nigger behavior i bet obama does the same shit that 's what happens when we let niggers run countries
4	good god i should have read that article a little at a time that was completely terrifying it 's incredible how this type of thing is happening somewhere , pretty much all the time how can entire nations get wrapped up in this type of insanity ? it 's mind boggling
4	well said how many good people die for doing the right thing , and how often do they go unsung there should be a memorial day for tall those who died fighting against violence
8	either really do n't get me wrong , i do n't think it 's right , but it 's the case
5	i think the biggest problem with the gacaca model is that it does n't emphasize reconcilliation enough similar " grassroot courts " from south africa ( which the gacaca was modeled after ) prioritized reconcilliation by imposing penalties on people who refused to admit and apologize for wrongdoing , but only gave a slap on the wrist to those that admitted their wrongdoing and apologized ( as far as i 've had it explained to me ) the one gacaca i witnessed had two gentlemen who were completely apathetic , laughing while being questioned , who were quite obviously guilty ( according to my translator ) , who got off because no one could prove they did anything conclusively the one young man who admitted his wrongdoing and profusely apologized ( not killing anyone , but being a part of the roadblocks as a young child , under <> years old ) was sentenced to multiple years in prison and another year of community service something wrong with that freakin system if you ask me
5	well , of course the holocuast " happened to europeans " as jews are also included in that group however , it 's inaccurate to say that we did n't intervene earlier because we did n't " care about europe or europeans " rather , we did n't care about jews , " homosexuals , communists , mentally and physically handicapped , the gypsies , the undesirables , the politically not in favour , etc " if the nazis tried to systematically kill everyone of french origin , or everyone in england , we would most likely have gotten involved much earlier because the targeted groups were people who we did n't care much about because of racism , ablism , and other forms of discrimination , we were much less willing to get involved
6	could you expand on why you do n't like it ?
7	i would also suggest romeo dallaire 's shake hands with the devil
4	thank you
7	i also recommend shake hands with the devil
2	no you are confused , you are describing <> event called wind of destruction ( http en wikipedia org wiki wind of destruction ) this is article about <> rwandan genocide
4	i thought this was a very good ones too beyond the gates ( http www imdb com title tt0420901 )
3	i was on the verge of tears watching ghosts of rwanda the carnage and destruction left in the wake of the genocide is unreal
1	that 's all very impersonal it 's not offensive to me ( i'm not a surburban white folk i guess ) but unless you 're incredibly distant and inhuman about the matter , genocide as a government response is just a little bit on the wrong side however much you might want to stretch a little ' justification ' the people being raped and slaughtered had as much influence on the state of affairs as you do on with your current government 's rullings i 'd imagine a lot of them did n't give a flying fuck of the differences between tutsi and hutu
4	good points , i presume when any western power bitches about a foreign country or crime committed by a regime there is usually a shittty smell coming from their spokespeople
2	my impression is that france was much more complicit in the genocide than the us
8	well i was being hyperbolic but oh my god that guy got <> downvotes if only that that happened every time a good discussion was to be derailed by a meme normally though the meme is the top rated i'm actually happy that reddit downvoted this dingdong but frequently , most of the thread and the top rated comments are canned phrases at least when i want it to be a serious original discussion i will check those subreddits out btw
2	i recommend that people watch the movie hotel rwanda it 's easy to brush these things off as " crazy shit that happens in other countries that does n't affect me " for the average idiot like myself , it really helps make these events more real
5	one thing that always shocks me is how people are so disconnected from the colonization of africa in terms of how recent it was no one seems to realize that most colonization did n't end until the <> 's and <> 's it was primarily europeans that were still actively oppressing these people that they " ruled " until just <> years ago if you meet an african of the age of <> or over , chances are they witnessed and participated in the ( long and painful ) end of colonization it 's as if most people just assume it happened over <> years ago and thus is irrelevant to present day status
8	spontaneousfiction , that was an excellent rendition of jean baptiste habyarimana 's last moments i like to imagine they went something like that to all who will read this , learning how families were tortured and butchered like this really makes my problems seem so petty by comparison it really makes one wonder how in the world we can stop such things from repeating and it makes me realize that one of the common threads linking this genocide to the others is deep division between groups of people if people treated each other as they wanted to be treated themselves , this horrific thing might be less common that 's my attempt to spread the way that i'm trying to live i'm not great at it but i keep at it hopefully , it 'll help with stuff like this
1	this is n't <> kindly fuck off
6	i like this novelty account it requires effort
4	it 's sad , man but applause for you you are good
8	because white people have never done anything horrible downvote for hateful x douchebaggery x ignorant interaction
2	i saw a documentary on this guy http en wikipedia org wiki general butt naked one of the rebel leaders in the civil war , interesting guy raped , beheaded , etc but the thing he admitted to that hit me the most ( if it was true ) was snatching up boys and girls and eating them with his rebel troops before war so it gave them power also he always fought naked admitted to killing thousands of people i do n't believe it all , but it sure is possible i find the thousands of people a big stretch , at least him himself killing thousands still , crazy shit
5	sometimes i really wish hell existed for people who do this kind of shit but again , i think the whole human kind is to blame
6	i knew it was a large massacre , but <> people killed in <> days ? ? holy shit
6	at risk of offending the righteous indignation of suburban white folks about the whole matter , tell me if i have this right the tutsi minority ran the country under the mamwi and generally did what most minorities in power tend to do oppress the majority this went on for a while with the usual uprisings and whatnot the tutsi regime struck up friendly relations with the colonials and kept things going the same for a while there was a coup , the tutsis got thrown out of power with some of the most influential ones going into exile the hutus set up a government the exiled tutsis come back to start some shit and take the place back the genocide is the hutus response is that about right ? if so , how is this in the least bit surprising ? i may be a bit squeamish when it comes to mass rape and machete killing , but it would seem that the hutus had something of a point
2	yeah let 's concentrate on past genocides and crimes while these are actually going on as we speak
8	maybe someone can make it into a rage comic
3	the movie was n't that great it reduced the event to a mediocre tv movie but the book we wish to inform you that tomorrow we will be killed with our families is pretty incredible
4	no doubt there were those who participated who were afraid not too especially given the extreme level of sheer violence unfortunately with large scope events this evil the aftermath is never cut and dry and the no system put in place to bring the perpetrators to justice is going to be perfect
2	kill their children and rape their wives , obviously
1	why not ? because they ' re motherfucking human beings , that ' s why because when someone treats you monstrously , you don ' t exponentially one up them what in the flying hell is wrong with you ?
8	while you may not be right on about the whole pc thing on this particular issue , there is a lot of truth to what you said here
1	fucking perfect
1	same here i needed a reason to stop reading rage comics anyway
4	lighten up , francis
6	<> hours of sunlight ? i thought rwanda was in central africa , not russia
2	so true it was criminal and he should have been held accountable by the world for it
1	the rwandan genocide , the act that i can always trace back as the catalyst for my transformation from staunch christian to atheist it s funny to think that the seed of doubt was first planted on a harmless missionary trip to rwanda and uganda the catch , it just happened to fall on the <> year anniversary of this horrible atrocity i still remember listening to the survivors stories and thinking what the fuck god one that always comes to mind is the one from a <> year old boy i first met him when he came down to play soccer with us ( it was a sports ministry ) but alas he couldn t , he could only sit and watch why ? his arms and legs were cut off by his father , why ? because his mom was a tutsi even as i m typing this i m fucking cutting onions that is just one of the many stories , so many more so many anyways i m sure this will be buried under other stories comments , but if you happen to stumble on this thanks for reading , just thought i would share
2	i could not agree more it is strange to me that we spend over a trillion dollars fighting in reaction to <> americans dying , and spend next to nothing on the systematic slaughtering of hundreds of thousands in countries like rwanda
2	" you would n't download an oprah , would you ? " shit , i probably would
8	that is simply not true the primary motivation behind the us' reluctance to aid rwanda was the black hawk down fiasco in somalia , which resulted in the death of a handful of us troops , that occurred not long before the rwandan genocide and after the ten belgian un blue helmets were murdered while guarding the acting prime minister , agathe uwilingiyimana , all the white people were evacuated , and the un pulled out it 's understood these days that the western powers were not willing to sacrifice their own troops to save the lives of black africans all the hand wringing in the world by western leaders , including president clinton , does not change the fact that we abandoned the rwandans , and knowingly left them to die
7	i registered just to upvote you for the immediate solemn respect your comment gave me
3	he mad
1	this is how you genocide reminds me of babi yar ( http en wikipedia org wiki babi yar ) in the holocaust the difficulties resulting from such a large scale action in particular concerning the seizure were overcome in kiev by requesting the jewish population through wall posters to move although only a participation of approximately <> , <> to <> , <> jews had been expected at first , more than <> , <> jews arrived who , until the very moment of their execution , still believed in their resettlement , thanks to an extremely clever organization these sick fucks learn the lessons of history and continue to refine their evil art
5	you 're missing the point as well there 's whole lot of barbaric things around the planet that you are blissfully unaware of some of those things involve decades of oppression , turmoil , and hatred to the point where genocide seems perfectly reasonable even suburbanites like yourself and captain caps above are n't all that far removed from tribal warfare
4	nice to know there 're are some other thinking folks around ) i think this even goes beyond regular idealism , i was waiting for someone to take a sort of ' non violence at all costs ' position i do n't agree with that position , but i do understand and respect it these folks , i think , are latching on to a sort of popular idealism that makes them feel civilized and therefore superior i'm sure if they ever spent any time amongst " the downtrodden " they claim to support they 'd be quite surprised at the reception they 'd likely get thanks btw
2	this has nothing to do with property i'm sort of insulted by your assertion and somewhat buoyed by peroperopero 's comments that the reasons are deeper and belie a quick soundbite that people are all so eager to give " it 's all about property rights " and " handovers " you ca n't distill it like that have you read the wikipedia article ? it 's one of the longest i 've ever read
4	good
3	i was recovering from serious injuries from an automobile collision when the rwandan genocide happened , and circumstances were such that i never knew about until <> years later , when i was doing a make up assignment in college in which i had to watch a frontline video on the genocide i watched the video in stunned silence , forcing myself to accept what i was seeing the most horrible thing to me about that event was not the one million humans that died , although that is indeed horrifying the most horrible thing about that event is that we , the usa , self proclaimed policemen of the world , had military troops there , in rwanda , when the genocide commenced , and we did nothing ! men and women were slaughtered and women were savagely raped a few feet from where us soldiers stood , yet following the direct orders of president bill clinton , we did nothing
2	while i do appreciate that these people are still being put on trial to this day , i do understand that there is no punishment grand enough that could ever balance out the horrors of the rwandan genocide nothing can ever be done to the perpetrators to alleviate all pain from the tutsis therefore , while we must still punish the war criminals , we must focus on an even more important task awareness everyone should know of the rwandan genocide , of the atrocities and inhumane acts an ounce of prevention is worth several tons of cure we can never right the wrongs of the genocide but we can make sure that nothing similar ever occurs again
1	if we get involved , everybody bitches about it if we do n't get involved everybody bitches about it
6	this is why we ca n't have nice civilizations
1	til there were a lot of massacres in <> ( http en wikipedia org wiki special search ? search <> massacres & go go )
5	too easy a sentence for this evil , unfortunately
5	" ghosts of rwanda " soul numbing , chilling stuff while looking down the swinging blade of pure evil especially the interview of fergal keane one of the things i hate most about this was president clintons lack of action in preventing this tragedy
6	also , i recommend the blue sweater i think this woman is actually written about in this book pre genocide she helps build microfinance institutions for her community and was the first of three women parliamentarians , if i'm not mistaken
5	three things bother me particularly about ' hotel rwanda ' during the whole movie you do n't actually see the genocide it 's always in the background , never in your face ' sometimes in april ' shoves it right through your throat and recollects all the stories that the survivors told me ( the militias , the dogs , the un , the checkpoints , the radio , the coward white men ) you do n't make the first movie on the rwandese genocide telling the story of ' the good hutu ' imagine if the first movie on the holocaust would have been ' schindler 's list ' no , first you tell the horror and why it came to be , then you can tell the stories of the few heroes such as paul rusesabagina , dallaire or of the few white priests who saved lives the big picture is simply missing in hotel rwanda it was not shot on location having been in rwanda , it is something that matters , because as dallaire said , rwanda is paradise all year btwn <> c and <> c , the rain never lasts long , <> hours of sunlight every day and everything just grows the fertile ground is at some locations <> metres deep ( ! ! ! ) it was hell in paradise
6	i think it really comes down to someone 's opinion on morality and human worth should we help where we can ? personally , i do not feel that americans are worth any more than someone in another country if we had these sort of atrocities in america , we would act with other countries , we do not why is that ? are they worth less ? can we not afford to ? i do n't believe there is an easy way to draw a line of where when we should act with regards to how much we spend , help , etc that said , i would love to see somebody justify why we should be in iraq but not have helped out in rwanda our priorities , they are messed up
4	you have a point , but the us get involved with wars more often than other countries , it 's not an undeserved reputation
2	particularly considering it was european colonial involvement that did a lot to instigate and perpetuate the racial divide and classism between the hutus and the tutsis if i'm recalling correctly , all colonial powers in rwanda for the past <> years played some pretty apparent favoritism with the tutsi people , creating social tension that eventually lead to explosive conflict
2	i think america catches more of the flak because it has a history of entering other nations during these situations ( korea , vietnam , iraq ) china 's never really had an interventionist policy so it was n't expected of them
6	i think the double standard that is being criticised is that the us is more than willing to get involved if there is monetary interrest ( iraq , libya etc ) but not so much when it 's sudan or rwanda denmark tends to stay out of most conflicts ( though they are in iraq for some reason ) so them staying out of rwanda is not something surprising atleast there isnt as much of a double standard involved
1	yupp the belgians actually came down with the peace delegation but were pulled home when <> or so belgian soldiers were killed when the french finally arrived on the scene it was more to secure french interrests in the area than to help stop the madness
1	how clear do i have to make this ? it 's not a fucking excuse it 's a reason understanding why these things happen is far more important than your bourgeois sensibilities
8	here 's a thought say it 's not an excuse it 's a reason in your first post instead of cleverly alluding bourgeoisie indeed
2	okay , again , how does the fact that it happens over and over make it an excuse for genocide because something happens it is right ? oh it 's " human nature " though hundreds millions of people managed to live their entire lives without murdering another person , let alone hunting down entire hundreds of thousands ? i really do n't understand the point you 're trying to make as relates to the original statements " this is n't an excuse for genocide " " why not " " because they 're human " next follows " you do n't know history " and " there are a lot of bad things you do n't know about people get angry and they think genocide is reasonable " the original question is how is that an excuse how is people getting angry an excuse for genocide ?

6	bbc east africa correspondent will ross says nyiramasuhuko showed no emotion as she was sentenced why would she ? she 's being sentenced outside of her home country by people who had nothing to do with it why should she care that they disapprove ?
2	say what now ? you 're displaying a lot of ignorance there <> i hope you 're not assuming that you could recognise all the jews based on their dark hair and hooked noses ? it just ai n't so <> you are obviously assuming without even looking into it , that black people anywhere will just look the same and even that they would n't have different types of name ? come on
1	" butare was once home to a large mix of hutu and tutsi people , and there was some resistance there to the orders to carry out the massacres the government of which nyiramasuhuko was a member dismissed the most senior district official a man who opposed the genocide he was never seen again when he was replaced , the massacres began and militias were flown in from the rwandan capital kigali to assist " unnamed senior district official you did the right thing , and you paid the price for your uncommon courage and i do not even know your name fuck everything about this
1	i once saw an interview with a hutu who was married to a tutsi woman when the mob came to their house to kill her , he had to pay them so they would shoot her instead of carving her up with a machete they then proceeded to kill her in front of his eyes whenever i feel rage start to build up over a firstworldproblem , i think about that guy
1	i remember learning about this in my genocide class a couple semesters before here at auburn university i was then shocked to find out that one of these guys lives here in the united states in the auburn opelika area in alabama of all places read some of the comments about it , and people seem to downplay the belgium involvement in this whole mess and not to jump on the " white people are evil " bandwagon , but africa was pretty much carved up by european forces , and despite having their own internal problems with each other , european and arabic forces further crippled the continent by the raping of africa 's natural resources is the reason why africa is in the position it is today sure they had things like slavery before the europeans came down , but there were some forms of slavery that not only provided freedom eventually for the enslaved but also allowed them to marry into the families of their masters and have some respect and when people say european or whites are the cause of all this , i do n't think it should be taken as all but the rich ones capable of manipulating the rest into going in a direction that they want to go if you want to see evidence of that in today 's world take a look at the united states government
5	truth i thought i wrote in there " sorry for hijacking a thread but this reminded me of " but apparently in my head i did

1	africa is a seriously fucked up continent
1	i do n't disagree with your argument there at all the colonizing countries arbitrarily drew national boundaries , installed puppet governorships and generally exploited the native populations to their benefit there was nothing ' free ' about the colonists ' regimes at all their lip service to property ownership was only to enrich privateering corporations whose charge was to gut the continent of its natural resources indeed , the 're turn ' of sovereignty to africans over the last century exacerbated the problem by handing over the reigns to favorite political parties leaders who ended up being genocidal , dictatorial maniacs you 're precisely in the right in your charge that the colonizing countries aided and abetted in this process the solution is figuring out how to redraw national boundaries respecting historical tribal nations and letting them do what they please hence sovereignty what i am arguing , and where i think we differ , is that we have a different interpretation on what private property actually is and looks like in a peaceful democracy , and whether it promotes civil life and reduces inter cultural conflict edit grammar and syntax
5	perhaps your students should look closer at home and ask why black on black crime is so high and kill each other while other communities are n't as self destructive i have a hard time accepting the white man being the blame for all black violence in the world
1	harsh i deplore ignorance as much as i am guilty of it but the average person has little reason to care and less power to do anything about it it 's terrible , but it 's true (
8	i think it 's less that people do n't care about the situation and more that they do n't know about it if u s networks had reported the details of the genocide like they do the lives of celebrities , i imagine that many people would have been up in arms
2	the major distinction between precolonial and colonial slave systems was their approach to the value of a slave colonialism and the advent of capitalism are symbiotic prior , slaves themselves were of value after , it was their labour output imagine the difference on the quality of life
4	gee thanks i do n't think anybody else has ever seen hotel rwanda
6	wow , that reference is old
1	i wish reddit found this as interesting as rage comics
2	yeah , a discussion about a man who tried to stand up to the rwandan genocide probably is n't the best time to reference a lame meme
3	great but incredibly horrifying article the more succinct news stories about the guilty verdict just do n't convey the gravity of it
2	we all know that it matters little which political party is in charge the real powers still advance their agenda but it is convenient to defuse the anger of the masses by letting them think they each are having a turn perhaps they are openly implementing right wing policies whilst under the banner of left because they know that the greater majority of people are too ill informed or addled by light entertainment to know or care about what they are doing ?
1	well , you are clearly forgetting that aggressive military expansionism is okay as long as you are not a western nation god , what is it with people and not always blaming the united states do n't they like , read books and stuff ?
1	wow somebody has no fucking sense of humour
1	i fucking lol 'd
4	lol there is no way we can properly outfit the afp without spending a ridiculous amount of money considering most of their stuff is equipment we gave sold them from the korean and vietam era wars i saw their airforce practice with f51 mustangs and i have pulled out kia 's out of huey helicopters after a gun fight with the asg this is ridiculous
2	just routine cock waiving between china and a u s vassal neither one of them is dumb enough to set off a naval conflict well , i hope not anyway
8	the philippines navy is very poorly outfitted , and not a match to the chinese by any measure , they would be squashed in any confrontation the us probably wo n't be able to supply them with any significant firepower
6	nothing will come of it , we are too tied economically with china and we ca n't handle them militarily ( i mean we are n't going to march to the capital and put up stupid mission accomplished banners )
6	i think the u s should definitely provide military aid to everyone around china possibly provide them with terrorist training like the al qaeda predecessor in afghanistan , they were great at fighting the soviet union back then )
2	arming a foreign country to fight a proxy war that policy never backfires cough iraq cough afghanistan cough
6	for all the tens of billions in aid taiwan has received , military planners in the west have calculated that it would withstand a chinese assault for about <> <> days at best , maybe only <> hours before it was occupied in the case of phillipines , lol this is a naval scenario and phillipines will never even have a hope in hell it 's piss poor , and us is broke , military aid is just to buy some influence in their regime two million filipinos were slaughtered by the us during it 's occupation of the country after they took over from the spanish
2	why would china want to invade the philippines ? do n't they have enough backwards peasants and ugly women already ? i mean , when the best your country has to offer is a bunch of malls , its time to just pack it in and admit defeat
2	there 's a reason why the u s is arming up people around china forget about going in yourself , if you give arms to those neighbouring china , you 're <> ) creating pressure , <> ) " making friends " , and <> ) ensuring that you have some reach into the area by being the main arms provider this whole thing is a bit murky is the u s right for arming these countries ? is china right for trying to bully its way into taking the south seas ? both are probably no , but international politics is a cruel mistress
2	yeah back in the <> we used to have some huge military bases there until the <> a volcano , filipino nationalism , and disgust over us military patronage of local prostitutes were all factors in the closing of the last us bases there !
4	the u s should attribute <> trillion dollars to outfit philippines with a military that can withstand china i think that 's a great idea
2	i'm sure people will see the us as the bad guys again for helping to enforce a un resolution , just like what happened with iraq did you know that china is trying to claim the entire south china sea despite having even signed a un treaty defining a nation 's territory as extending <> miles from its shores ? the bastards are trying to build oil wells on filipino territory !
2	the us essentially does that with japan and korea already anyways the notion that it can afford to completely revamp the military of the philippines , which still relies on remittances from overseas filipinos as a principal means of attracting foreign money its sovereign public debt is already pretty high at <> in short , the us would essentially be paying for that country 's military entirely , which is simply unfeasible
2	well i suppose i 'll have to wait and see what the result is here i think i recall that the economist 's view was that china is picking on a weak neighbor to try to take something that is n't rightfully theirs
2	i think that the reefs in question are within <> miles of the palawan coastline am i wrong about the locations of the reefs or are the chinese now disputing that palawan 's not a philippine territory ?
8	i'm well aware of the uncls , but most of that deals with distance from coastlines when said coastlines are in dispute ( in this case the islands ) the potential exclusive economic zones of the countries involved vary wildly
2	http www gmanews tv story <> nation phl pushes rule of law in west philippine sea at un meet http en wikipedia org wiki united nations convention on the law of the sea you 're trying too hard no need to go back <> , <> years when there 's a treaty from less than <> years ago that the peoples republic of china signed the land in question here is within <> miles of filipino coastline and is , by the very standards that china recently agreed to adhere to , filipino territory
6	i'm suspicious who why anyone would downvote your post it 's laughable what they are calling " genetic modification " when anyone without bias would simply call it high quality
4	no , genetic modification refers to inserting foreign dna ( to express very specific proteins ) into the genome best example , round up ready corn and soybeans edit larger , more healthy plants that yield more are typically f1 hybrids , a product from heterosis ( aka hybrid vigor )
1	yea , why the fuck is the media reporting good news as bad news
1	importing it is kind of a bitch
6	yeah that 's a little weird , it 's definitely hilarious to call it ' genetic modification ' is it a monsanto downboat crew ? o o
6	the wrong part is mistaking selective breeding and gm
2	what a load of horse shit regular everyday marijuana can be <> <> thc there 's no genetic modification going on to get that , they 're just now getting the modern seeds everyone else has had for ages and growing it instead of their native , lower potency varieties

4	it would be interesting to see actual gm weed , one that needs less light and has a shorter growth cycle would be far more interesting then ever more potent bud
2	<> per kilo ? what a shitty market for the sellers
1	oh boy , dro from amsterdam in california got to colombia big whoop its just cheap as fuck
1	and this is coming from a science oriented publication shame
6	lol at genetically modified this is n't franken weed it 's selective breeding it 's not like monsanto is genetically fucking with weed and putting roundup in it to prevent bugs from getting to the plants they 're doing that in the food we eat !
8	yet another " super pot " scare ooooo it 's a powerful drug now ! here is the probable writer 's twitter account https twitter com ! luisrobayo let him know he is enabling the drug warriors

6	so , a place that executes people for homosexual behavior is encouraging homosexual behavior why do n't i quite believe this

1	i wish america would just fuck off
4	i feel like this joke is being totally misapplied the joke is n't some tenuous connection with absurdity , it has rules for funerals to kill you in russia , it would have to be assumed that you kill funerals in america that does n't make sense a good example of this joke would be " in soviet russia , television watches you ! " seeing as how people watch television quite frequently in america , and soviet russia 's notorious kgb was apt to spy on their own people , the joke is not only correct in usage , but also in observation try to keep that in mind next time
1	she might not be dead yet if she wakes up again , i would declare her as a fucking zombie
4	many agree that if a family , couple or young woman are not in a position to have a child for financial reasons then abortion is a responsible choice the financial aspect is one of the main reasons female fetuses are aborted in developing countries i by no means consider it a good thing with the skewed male female ratio , but at the same time i have to say it seems a bit hypocritical to point the finger at one but not the other , because the basic reason for getting the abortion is the same
6	regardless of what you point your finger at , i find the long term effects of this problem to be very interesting and troubling buying or poaching women from neighboring countries , purchasing u s bonds to cash in for a bride later ( uh oh ) , and increased violence among a bunch of sexually frustrated men on an only slightly related note , n korea was never mentioned in this article but i would n't be surprised if women became a major export of theirs to china given their terrible economic situation
2	so does this mean you think it 's related to racism , violence , and succeeding from the north ? honestly , i'm originally from ohio , moved to texas , and it would be cool to have a confederate flag license plate at this point it 's more of a homage to the past than directly related to the war no one bitches about the confederate flag on the general lee , why would a tiny one on a license plate matter ?
6	those who equate the " confederate " flag ( not actually the official flag of the confederacy ) with racism are displaying their ignorance of history and or their propagandizing of the modern system the civil war was first and foremost about state 's rights if slavery was the prime or sole mover in the war , why did some slave states not ever secede ? why did others in the northern confederacy only secede after the north attacked the south ? finally , mr shelton displays an appalling lack of historical knowledge when he declaims that the confederacy wanted to destroy the current governmental structure the united states federal government was formed by individual states who agreed that it was in their best interests to work together they voluntarily banded together later the southern states felt that it was no longer in their best interests and chose to voluntarily leave the association at that point it ceased to be voluntary and the us government turned into the world 's biggest gang once in , never out history it only works if you know it both the poster and mr shelton are displaying their ignorance to better understand what happened and how we should react to it , look not to the civil war but the negotiations over the formation of the consitution and the fight to get it ratified
2	greece 's problems are much more than that but i was pointing out that the recent attention to to these problems was a result of the economic downturn , which hurts their main industries much more than it would hurt other nations of comparable size greece joined the eu something like <> years ago which itself is significant since , if the country has consistently been running deficits , that implies some measure of certainty over its economic future if it had been able to avoid scrutiny for so long , which is something they no longer have with the economic recession and no one is calling germany nazis over this right now the package given to greece is given solely because no one else is liable to buy their debt since the chances of greece defaulting is a very real possibility greece has many structural problems and the public sector is bloated with assurances and liabilities that are simply beyond its ability to pay off i personally do n't see any reason what entitlement the greeks have in protesting , since the primary function of a democracy is to represent the will of the voters and they 've quite frankly had <> years since military dictatorship to get that into order , and i do understand the measure of anger in the european population from germany and other essentially creditor nations which will be primarily responsible for paying their lifestyle
6	greece 's government no longer has the ability to borrow money on the market because there is no investor confidence in the country 's ability to pay it back therefore , it either risks extremely high interest rates on the market ( since it 's essentially become a junk bond ) , or it takes up the eu offer to restructure the debt using money from germany and the imf the thing about greece is that the global recession hurt them more so than most other nations greece 's primary industries are tourism and shipping with tourism , it 's plainly obvious that no one 's going to spend thousands to travel there anymore when there is n't even the ability to pay the bills back home with shipping , it 's also clear that the volume of trade has fallen since the recession hit , and that this is only slowly going to come back once the recession is over , and with certain measures that are essentially going to be imposed on greece for austerity and internal auditing , it stands to reason that greece has the ability to turn small budget surpluses that can slowly begin to pay back the amount it owes obviously this is n't surefire by any measure , but , if there 's any logic to not expelling greece from the eu , it 's this
2	the extra wages are just the benefits that we do n't take each month ( like in your country for example ) , but we only take them altogether twice a year can you please explain what you mean ? what benefits that you do n't take each month ?
6	how is this supposed to help ? absolutely no idea the greeks are saddled with even more debt to pay back in july and august , the greek government has to redeem bonds to the tune of <> <> without <> from the eurozone and the imf the fifth tranche of last year 's <> billion bailout how on earth is greece supposed to pay back those <> billion euro bailouts ? they already could n't service their original debt last year at the same time , their economy is driven into recession with stringent austerity measures a statement said that the draconian package of <> in spending cuts and tax rises plus a <> privatisation programme eu politics are well known for being stunningly irrational , but this really defies logic
4	while this decision definitely needs to be viewed in a critical light , can we refrain from making comments like these they 're sectarian and really do n't add to the discussion at all
7	big hint you all are the only ones that call your country that
4	if greece can hold out until the world economy returns to a boom state then they can start earning money through tourism again
4	o k , thanks for clarification , so i guess we are pretty much on the same page but i do disagree on your assessment of their economy the main industries ( if you want to call it that ) of greece are tourism and shipping ( they also produce most of italys " original " toscana olive oil , but that is another matter ) both industries took a small hit , but not in any way comparable what other countries had to suffer through most of greeks big ships are ferries and tankers , and while these were affected , there is still demand for their service , even in times of crisis ( as opposed to container ships ) the truth is , greece produces next to nothing that is of any interest to the outside world and i really do n't understand your argument about greece joining the eu <> years ago yes they did , yes they ran deficits for all this time but until the creation of the eurozone the national economies were a national matter and nothing other countries or the eu were concerned with the greeks were known to cook their books , but mainly just to get eu subsidies nobody , including the greek government really knew the full extent of their obligations i also disagree on " no one is calling germany nazis over this " there are actually quite a few general opinion over germany has never been good in greece ( fortunately most germans do n't speak greek , otherwise public opinion would change quite a lot ) , but there are many signs at the protests that call merkel a nazi there is also this common sign of the european stars as a swastika , which i find particularly offensive
4	if you have " absolutely no idea " how the bailouts are supposed to work , how can you say whether it is logical or not ? nice try how is this supposed to help ? absolutely no idea but a bit too obvious alan greenspan , former federal reserve chairman , said a default by greece is '' almost certain '' ( http www smh com au action printarticle ? id <> ) european politicians faced unpleasant choices and had to respond but rather than decisively addressing the problem , they essentially opted to kick the can down the road ( http blogs reuters com mohamed el erian <> <> <> europe struggles with bad choices ) everyone seems to agree that what should happen will not happen that is a shrinking of the eurozone , a devaluation of europe 's peripheral " currencies " and a corresponding cut in their indebtedness the eu has become so constitutionally flawed that few of its states dare put continued membership to referendum ( http www guardian co uk commentisfree <> jun <> eurozone greece debt crisis )
5	sorry , unitedkingdish gentleman
1	oh fuck
4	england 's decision not to adopt the euro sure is saving them a lot of money
4	as an eu citizen , i am glad to help out but i'm afraid the money will once again be pocketed by the corrupt people in power
2	it 's all monopoly money anyway
4	here we go again , round two , <> down the drain , the average european taxpayer is thankful
1	and people wonder why the rich get richer why are the middle class german tax payers repaying rich german bankers that lent money to other rich people in greece that will never pay it back ? on top of all this , there are a lot of germans who think this is a great idea what the fuck
6	can someone seriously explain to me the reasoning that lead to this decision ? how is this supposed to help ?
8	the slow and painful end to the greek state
6	so , they payed off goldmann sachs what now ?
6	got any pics of your yacht ? i'm thinking of taking up sailing
4	greek retirees with <> yachts each would like to thank the average european employee
4	you know they have <> working days off each year for holidays , and like <> midnoon breaks , and yet they produce almost nothing except tourism douchebag country , leeching on eu money thank you greece !
6	what a load of crap greece still runs a huge deficit this money is n't just for the banks , it is also for current expenses and there are several infrastructure programs running right now , again financed mainly by the french and german taxpayers so yes , it is very much happening and has been for decades
2	german people invest in banks german banks invest in greece greece did stupid shit and is going down ? ? ? bail out to ensure greece has the chance to pay back the bail out is far , far less than what is invested
2	i think you do n't understand a lot of things these problems have nothing to do with the greek banks , they are not the ones who caused this problems nor are they in any way as exposed as the banks in several other nations it was the greek government that took these credits , so yes , this is very much greek national debt
1	eh , but he 's right rich people fuck up , poor people pay but if poor people fuck up you bet your ass that they 'll squeeze every dime out of you in other words old news
4	yeah , we ( the greeks ) live in our small paradise , driving our mercedes , drinking uzo by the pool and thinking how we will spend our next <> years of life after retirement clearly you have no idea how life is in greece , so do n't be so fucking sure of your opinion try to live with greek wages in greece for a year , see for yourself the amazing healthcare , the nice streets , the luxury of everyday life and you can see in sintagma how happily they accept the money that have nothing to do with the average greek citizen
2	eu politics are well known for being stunningly irrational , but this really defies logic if you have " absolutely no idea " how the bailouts are supposed to work , how can you say whether it is logical or not ? fyi , the bailouts will be used to pay for expired bonds as well as greek deficit spending the money that goes into expired bonds will decrease the debt as much as it increases it the money that goes to deficit spending will increase it essentially the expensive loans ( bonds ) are replaced by a cheaper loan ( bailout )
6	it 's really simple loan them more than can ever pay , foreclose on the land , the natural resources and create a nation of indentured servants how else do you think corporations get sovereignty ?
6	the whole nazi argument is ridiculous most people in greece consider such name calling to be below the belt , and useless much like many voices in germany calling <> million people lazy scoundrels are also not voices in the mainstream
4	because you 're essentially saying that if i have a problem with some feature of islam , i must have a problem with all of it no that 's not what i ment , but you fail you to understand that <> verse <> subject , nor the subject is limited by that verse take adultery for example ( reddit 's favourite ! ) , there are limited verses in quran talking about it , not all quran talks about adultery those verses set the definition the meaning the conditions for punishment and the punishment etc , those verses are not in one page or sequential add to that hadiths that talk about adultery , they must be taken as explaination of quran so if you want to discuss the topic of adultery in islam , you must bring the subject as whole with all the related verses and hadiths that does n't mean brining all quran and islam 's message about monotheism , doing good , after , prophets and angels into the discussion here is a poor example when you debate a certain law ( x ) in the united states , you should bring up the consititutional ammendment above that law ( the one that made it possible ) , and sub laws ( or court cases ) that emerged from the law in question ( the little x 's ) , bring all those to the discussion to make it revleant that does n't mean you bring up all united states laws and consitution ammendments ( all the a to z 's )
2	most religious texts are sexist they were fabricated in earlier times , where women were not even considered people as to ahmed 's point , he 's saying that whatever point op was making is irrelevant since it is because it places a stereotypes on all muslims based on what their scriptures say that all muslims do n't value gender equality which is not the case , case in point the article
4	thank you for your contribution to reddit , you have helped advance the human race
4	<> 's sitcoms ? that i would like to see
4	not the west , just assholes like yourself
6	what man believes at one time or another has no bearing on the truth
2	she might be right if the religion were based on " whatever you can find that you like most " instead , it 's run on a " whatever was written decreed last is actually the real religion , and anything before that was written by satan " system
6	what ! ? muslims denying basic human rights based on gender ! ? this article is clearly racist propaganda by the west !
1	when a group of people rely on a <> year old text to define human rights , they are fucked right from the get go
4	islam gives dignity to women just ask muhammed how he dignified his nine year old wife bow chika bow wow
4	and you do n't seem to realize that islam is not like protestant christianity , where only things in the main holy text ( bible koran ) are considered part of the belief system
4	culture and religion are one and the same muslims say islam is a ' way of life ' for them a ' way of life ' sounds like culture to me
5	i'm not going to discuss if the qur ' an is man made or not , because this is n't the topic but , sadly , it is not true that all of us believe humans are created equal how many years were black people enslaved in america for example ? when did they have the right to go to the same restaurant as the rest of americans ?
6	so most muslims have a shitty primitive culture unconnected to their common primitive shitty religion ? what bad luck
6	no , that 's illogical it 's similar to taking things out of context not at all the context you provided does n't make the quotations i provided sound better or different the meaning of those four qur ' an verses is the same and sounds equally as shitty , before you added your blurb , and after if a verse depends on another verse or another hadith for explaining , conditions and circumstances , then you must bring all those together no , i must not because you 're essentially saying that if i have a problem with some feature of islam , i must have a problem with all of it i reject that idea i lestin to american political news and i cheer for conservatives i'm not surprised but that man ( rush limbough ) is an idiot for his out of context bashing he 's an idiot for many reasons , and out of context bashing is the least of his sins
4	very good ) thank you , and yes , everything you explained here i 've already known i know how muslims understand and approach these issues nothing you say here has been a revelation or an eye opener for me i 'll upvote you because i want more people to see the true islamic point of view before making decisions about islamic doctrine and its relevance to this or that event in the world finally , you ca n't just take one verse and come bashing islam on reddit without knowing the <> verses and hadiths that the set the rules and conditions for that verse yes i can and i will i do n't necessarily have a problem with every single feature of islam i'm going to bring up those features which cause me the most grief
4	thank you very much for this
4	i ment empty line , like paragraph sperator like above , but without the dot
4	it 's like a combination of canon law ( http en wikipedia org wiki canon law ) and common law ( http en wikipedia org wiki common law )
1	ummm , looks like i am missing something here who is trying to convert you to islam ? apart from the fact that your citation is completely irrelevant to my comment on the previous asshole , i do not see anyone trying to convince you about islam a fact that simply means that what you think is completely irrelevant , plus it is so stupid of you thinking you could " embarrass " me with an out of place citation one last thing , even though i have not met you or even talked to you , you seem to be one of those know it all freaks who troll religious people for fun so just fuck yourself , or find another asshole to do it for you in case you are dickless , which most probably you are
4	by the way , does anyone know the code for adding new line ? do you mean like this ? ? if that 's what you mean , then end your line with a double space
4	the band joy division took their name from these women it was not just concentration camp inmates , it was all of the conquered people russians , ukrainians , every race , creed and color in asia , the japanese army had " comfort women " that were issued to every platoon one woman for <> to <> men koreans , chinese , japanese and some round eyes from indonesia and china one of the great shames of the americans pacific campaign was what happened to the women when the crack japanese army that was attacking eastern india surrendered to the british as they were withdrawing into burma , the british had a problem with what to do with the " comfort women " should they be left with their rapists or should they be treated differently ? they were , i believe , segregated in a separate prison camp in australia the " comfort women " that were with the japanese occupiers in the island chains were murdered by the occupiers i do n't want to even think of how they died the only place that significant numbers of " comfort women " were captured was rabaul , the huge base that was bypassed on the new britain island the japanese women who carried their children off of the cliffs on guam , to certain death , had a real good idea of what would happen if the americans captured them armies commit atrocities the russians raped their way across eastern germany the allies in the west committed over <> , <> reported rapes in occupied france during the liberation the german army occupying france executed <> to <> soldiers for rape i have no idea of how the allies stacked up against that

6	what are you talking about ?
4	huge pro gaddafi rally in tripoli raw footage ( http www youtube com watch ? v jwznhk3zv4u & feature player embedded ) there are somethings that western media does not like to show
1	ok , if you didn t think he was a delusional psychopath before , i m sure you do now what a fucking tool see europe ? this is why you should have your own militaries capable of ending situations like this as quickly as possible but at least now you re also acting in self defense gaddafi basically just gave the world justification to off him
2	i wish everybody on reddit would watch this video http www youtube com watch ? v f7nsxfnzjgw & feature youtube gdata player reddit is acting like a bunch of mindless war cheerleading goons right now it 's embarrassing take whatever opinion you like after watching this video , but just remember that the pentagon has been planing on invading libya for nearly a decade
4	kinda like <> months ago when gaddafi claimed his navy has sunk a nato warship i guess gaddafi does n't remember how well that ended for his navy
2	unbelievable rhetoric , even from a gaddafi apologist like you curious , varietygamer , if you hate the west so much , why not leave australia and return to your serbian motherland ?
6	what about the rest of the articles where they talk about libya ? any thoughts ?
6	what 's this ? that 's little kids trying to be clever by being contrarian do n't believe everything coming out of gaddafi 's mouth
3	privitization that 's the key word socialists should die and be condemned as terrorists here 's a quick overview of what gadaffi was able to accomplish in his <> year rule http www youtube com watch ? v lxlqauupjwu & feature youtube gdata player yeah , he 's guilty of ordering a violent supression of a popular uprising that shit happens all the time in countries all over the world gadaffi is specially targeted because of the strategic interests of the united states and nato brutal regimes exist all over the globe this is cherrypicking events and words in an attempt to justify using preemptive military action the neocons run the country now it does n't matter which party you elect
3	and this is how a terrorist is born gaddafi 's love affair with terrorism started way before this intervention ( lockerbie bombing murder of yvonnefletcher )
4	i would n't call him a tactical genius but you definitely gotta give the guy credit for being a survivor some of that is good tactics , some of its luck , but he 's found a way to hang on all these years i do n't think anyone excepted him to be around months after nato decided it was finally time for him to go
6	that 's working out so well in afghanistan , may as well add another asymmetrical war of attrition into the mix what happens if libyan special forces blow up an oil tanker in the suez canal and oil hits <> a barrel ?
6	what 's this ? information that contradicts the popular narrative ? what are you ? some kinda information terrorist ? seriously , though , i find it disturbing that your post presenting facts and opinions outside of the current war cheerleading bi polar reddit populous is downvoted without any kind of attempt to refute the articles you posted sure gadaffi is guilty of ordering a crackdown on this faceless uprising does anybody even know what the rebels want ? why is this uprising taking place ? and if your answer is that gadaffi is a brutal dictator who has been in control for <> years , you should watch this and then ask how much good he has done vs bad http www youtube com watch ? v lxlqauupjwu & feature youtube gdata player
1	that 's working out so well in afghanistan but the u s did not have the support of the people in afghanistan the majority of afghanis are opposed to u s involvement and are sympathetic to the taliban and other extremist forces the majority of libyans are welcoming u s and european involvement and see it as the only way of stopping gaddafi who has killed many of their friends and family members korea , vietnam , afghanistan , and iraq were all huge fuck ups the libyan intervention however is probably the first war in a long time where the u s is fighting for the right side
6	um , actually , their presences were practically token compared to the us and uk and they 're running out of ammunition in libya like , wtf ? why get involved in a gun fight when you ca n't afford more bullets when they run out ? now nobody 's gonna really take them seriously
6	i i read a lot of things people ask me questions about some of the things i talk about , not having heard it before i kind of look at them , and explain i thought i had perspective i think this is the first time i 've been honestly surprised in a while thank you
4	i do n't really get your point the taliban were the state at the start of the afghan war , and they still claim to be the legitimate representatives of the afghan people if nato escalates the conflict , it 's quite likely that the libyan government will quickly fall and there will be a guerrilla war resembling the one in afghanistan , with a movement of people fighting a foreign installed government anyway , at this point several countries in nato only recognize the transitional council as being the government of libya , so since they are now the state , by definition they are fighting the people
3	and this is how a terrorist is born just some people call them terrorist others call them resistance fighters freedom fighters bombing and killing in someone 's else country their home ( compound ) , family ( grandson and other family members ) and then complain when they do the same to you keep it up all nato countries and soldiers you are doing a great service for the military industrial complex
1	i wonder how the people against this intervention would feel if it was their country being terrorized by an insane fascist , their mothers and daughters gang raped by soldiers , their life long friends executed by government death squads ? would they still be saying " stop meddling in other countries affairs " ? this is a great example of " my life is great , why give a fuck about other people " but hey , if we pull out of libya and let gaddafi 's genocide go unopposed , hollywood gets to make another awesome movie like hotel rwanda !
1	it 's funny how there 's more pro gadaffi activity on reddit than in libya the man has exterminated a large chunk of his own people , nearly every libyan has lost family members to his regime at this point countless women and children have been raped by his regime and now he has threatened to murder innocent european civilians you people make me sick while libyans are sacrificing their lives in an attempt to get rid of this dictator and bring their country back to normality , you 're just sitting in your fucking armchairs spouting conspiracy theories you give the left a bad name
4	xpost response from lesser thread " in response to his brutal attacks on rebels " , nato is doing the same thing they did to yugoslavia a country is poised to upset the eu market and wham everyone starts dropping bombs calling it a humanitarian mission this stuff is so blatantly obvious now since we got so much other stuff going on that we are not reacting to people wonder why iran wants nukes ? they want to be militarily off the table because they know whats going on it 's called free market imperialism and it 's weapons are loans , sanctions and then bombs let libya fight it 's own civil war since both sides are ruthless , there are no good guys if we succeed at ousting gaddafi the country will be a shell and it 's resources robbed and it 's people disenfranchised
3	he ca n't even carry out attacks in benghazi any more also , is n't this bit of a shift from his claim to be protecting the world from terrorists like al qaeda ? oh , why bother
6	what are you talking about ? back when there was <> <> rolling media coverage of the situation in libya both bbc news and al jazeera constantly played videos of pro gadaffi rallies in tripoli
4	upvote for a very informative <> minutes , makes me want to check out the book and i'm usually pretty lazy but its good to hear this information from horse 's mouth about what our goals have been for so long
4	reddit is n't acting like anything , gaddafi is a dictator who tried to use his nation 's army against his own civilian population and then things went awry for him it 's his own fault if he wanted libya to thrive he would have abdicated immediately , but now he 's gone too far
4	watch the you tube link do as he says , it 's <> minutes please , you 'll more than likely thank him for it it 's not a pop bubble gum , fostered together in a basement link , it 's us general wesley clark at the commonwealth club of california courtesy of fora i wo n't say what it says <> minutes

6	what do you propose ? stand idle and watch gadaffi exterminate his own people ?

4	it 's probably not meant to convince anyone , more like an incentive to those who were planning to have it done " sometime " to do it now
4	they probably will keep up the incentives for years but that aside , a sterilization today is worth more than a sterilization next year , simply from a demographic standpoint if you have a net positive growth rate ( which india does ) , then the population is a pyramid with a narrow base that widens the higher you go ( as you go forward in time ) removing one reproductive link at the base is worth more than removing one near the top , if population control is your goal india is actually doing pretty darn good at population control the net population growth rate slipped to <> <> in <> according to the world bank that 's <> on the list , about the same as the population growth rate in the us , back in the <> 's it also continues to decline steadily

6	you really love this quote , do n't you ? you cited it twelve times in less than twenty four hours in various subreddit what 's your problem dude ? besides , citing kanin who has long been discredited might not be the strongest argument you could make to support a fellow perv
2	a dangerous message now being sent by the international community courtesy of israel , greece , and the united states " peaceful protests of israel will not be tolerated , even when that protest includes sending humanitarian aid to a country that is n't israel , but merely borders it " so what now ? shall the palestinians in gaza commit mass suicide to satisfy the needs of the international community ? a self inflicted genocide ? or would that be perceived to be an attack on israel as well ? i am utterly disgusted
4	until now we were supportive of the palestinians and , although unofficially , we were sending aid , allowed the flotilla to use our ports and there were greeks participating i suppose that since in the last incident turkey israel diplomatic relationships took a hit , either the greek or israeli diplomats started cooperating iirc yesterday netanyahu called the greek pm a " good friend "
4	breaking laws non peaceful it 's called civil disobedience unarmed non violent actions like the flotilla can certainly be considered peaceful
6	what does docking in egypt have to do with any of this ?
3	sending food to starving people is not inconsistent with " peaceful protest " nor is it inconsistent with " non violent " protests you 've heard the term " civil disobedience ? " by your logic , rosa parks was committing a violent protest by insisting to sit at the front of the bus because the " law " restricted her from doing it this is a cop out it 's an excuse by israel ( as it was by southern racists ) to play victim and decry those on the flotilla mission as terrorists
1	nobody in gaza is starving seriously people in gaza are wealthier , healthier , and better fed than most people in the non oil arab states their life is n't awesome , for sure the serious travel restrictions and the attacks brought upon them by hamas islamic jihad provocations are awful but they 're not starving , and people in cairo and damascus are the " human rights " crowd has their priorities way fucked up as for the flotilla if they 're just delivering food , why would n't they just agree to let israel inspect it first ?
4	and such a calamity it is i find this relieving there is a huge shortage of people willing to actually consider the potential severity of this disaster , however , this is an article addressing only the human cost i would also like to see some authority figures address the environmental cost as well i can only hope that the consequences of this disaster wo n't be buried in time and controversy
4	i 've gotta wonder , though why sour on the whole concept of nuclear power ? ok , it seems that due to a culture of cronyism and respecting authority over being right , the earthquake and tsunami caused very severe problems but there are other , newer , more secure nuclear power plants that survived just fine the current disaster throws light on government incompetence and corruption , it 's not like nuclear power is " evil " or inherently more dangerous than burning hydrocarbons ( environmental degradation ) , hydroelectric power ( earthquakes can damage dams and cause catastrophic flooding ) , etc the problem here is an incompetent , corrupt , self serving government , not how japan is powered the fact that it happened to be through neglect of nuclear safety that japan 's government screwed its people seems incidental , if it had n't been this it would have been something else
6	the whole thing is really just tragic what 's even more tragic is that , here in america , there is absolutely no coverage of it on tv barely anyone here even knows whats going on over there i'm afraid that no one here will learn anything from this i can remain hopeful , but it looks as though nothing is going to change
4	japan has such a rich and diverse geography that more native species of trees are found in the relatively very small japanese archipelago than in the rest of the northern non tropical hemisphere it is so naturally abundant that the indigenous yayoi people were the first people in the world to develop pottery why that 's surprising is because like north america 's pacific northwest the indigenous people developed complex civilizations without agriculture i own a very small piece of that land you can dig down with only your hand easily for meters and find only rich loam that the ldp allowed that rich natural heritage to be irradiated by incompetence and corruption , contracting with ge while at the same time taking millions of dollars from the cia , is an ecological crime of historic proportions such betrayal by corporate interests is not unique to japan and that to me is really what americans should take away from this and what hopefully the japanese people will find an arena in which to find some justice and recompense
6	the home secretary was horrified what a bunch of hypocrites this man did n't actually harm anyone and did the best he could under shitty circumstances i ca n't understand why he should be considered a war criminal

4	of course china will they 're swimming in cash thanks to their manipulation of the yuan and europe is a major market for them they 're also playing a long term game they 're not hamstrung by short term election cycles and think <> , <> , or <> years down the road economic and political opportunities are being bought on the cheap they 're investing in africa for this reason , too they 're locking in land and resource deals now , while it 's cheap our governments ? not so forward thinking
4	as the comments of the linked article say , the last picture is the most shocking thank you for posting this
1	fuck riot police , they turn any peaceful protest violent now they 're just asking for it
2	utter bullshit and fear mongering
4	ahhh , thank you for clearing that up )
4	i do n't believe you understand context or have reasoning if i say good work as i did in the sentence , i would assume people would think i am saying good work to the good guys , not the bad so , " good for them " translates to , " good for the marines , no deaths and the message is sent " the marines had no deaths and they sent the message , which i think is crystal clear you might have a little trouble , but i'm willing to help you out if you need it
4	i figured that " good work " would mean they could arrest the suspects without violence this is just " work "
1	oh look , it 's apparatchik when not posting conspiracy theories about those awful joos , apparatchik likes to spend his time on reddit defending backward islamists probably a hypocritical muslim or a typical run of the mill reddit islamophile here 's a thought how about you fuck off to some stone age muslim state , where they hang homosexuals and treat women like cattle ?
4	i like this game where we invent meanings for words that have no basis in fact or basis in history is zionism the new fascism , a word so weighed down by negativity that no one bothers to actually consider its real meaning before using it as a byword for all that is evil and terrible ? i 'll give you a hint zionism is a <> century secular movement based on economic theories of mutualism the focus on the creation of a jewish state had nothing to do with religious beliefs the founder of zionism , theodor herzl , was not a religious jew instead , the motivation for the establishment of a jewish state had to do with his belief that jews would never be accepted by the predominantly non jewish european countries that hosted them two formative experiences led him to this conclusion the first was his participation in a german nationalist movement , where he experienced antisemitism , and the second was the dreyfus affair , which happened when he was in paris very few jews agreed with his position and zionism remained a fringe movement until after the holocaust , when the european jewry came to agree with herzl 's assessment that not feeling particularly jewish yourself does not protect bigots from discriminating against you for your anscestry in fact , much of the opposition to zionism in the <> century came from religious jews , who , in keeping with orthodox jewish tradition , maintained that jews should not return to the holy land before the coming of the messiah , who had not yet arrived there are some very religious jews that still hold this position particularly by <> century standards , the " father of zionism " was n't much of a jew he spoke neither hebrew nor yiddish , he did not receive an official bar mitzvah , and his motivations for the creation of a jewish state were explicitly secular the choice of palestine as a jewish homeland was somewhat arbitrary and mainly for cultural continuity in his seminal work , der judenstaat , in which he outlines his plans for a jewish state , he explicitly names argentina as a possible candidate the benefits of palestine had mainly to do with its proximity to europe and its importance in jewish history herzl also saw an economic angle the ottoman empire was in debt and he believed he might be able to convince the ottoman sultan to allow the jews to create a homeland in palestine in exchange for them taking on the ottoman empire 's foreign debt to this end he actually met with members of the ottoman court , including the sultan , to pitch this plan it was rejected what israel does today is not in any way defensible but stop claiming that zionism is about religion it 's not not today , and not ever i really ca n't stand people who do n't bother to do a little reading
8	the focus on the creation of a jewish state had nothing to do with religious beliefs what ? i agree that many zionists and their supporters are secular but to claim that religion has nothing to do to with zionism in the past or present is disingenuous for example , we have many american evangelicals zionists supporting the state of israel solely because they believe it will fulfill some sort of biblical prophecy many settlements in the west bank are occupied by jewish fanatics who believe that god promised them that land the choice of palestine as a jewish homeland was somewhat arbitrary and mainly for cultural continuity sorry i do n't buy it we have a ton of israeli apologists here claiming that they have more of a right to live in palestine than arabs why ? because their holy book says so you are manipulating historical facts to fit your own version of zionism
1	i'm not jewish , you islamophile fuck omg those poor muslims why cant people just let them blow themselves up in cafes in peace ? fuck off you leftist piece of shit
4	wow , really ? netanyahu 's really reaching on that one
4	you are manipulating historical facts to fit your own version of zionism no , i do n't have " my own version " of zionism , because i'm not a zionist i 've just actually bothered to read something about zionism , as you apparently have not i could n't care less what evangelical americans call themselves or think zionism is about i also could n't care less about the religious motivations of crazy settlers that these people exist and are bad is not in question , but making them representative of zionism is like calling stalin a fascist
6	why did you change your name from glengyron ?
1	i am usually of the ' fuck israel ' mindset ( still am actually ) but i have to admit , this shit happens in every thread on a similar topic generally i might not mind but when it is accompanied by the smug , self righteousness found on reddit , it starts to become jarring the more i visit this place , the more i realise most of the posters are really no different than the fox news viewers they claim to despise so much the only difference between the two groups is that one says ' fuck you , i do n't like ( insert group here ) and i do n't care what you think ' while the other group tries to intellectually rationalise their ignorance and bigotry ( this works very well on reddit , as they are always up voted by like minded idiots , while any argument is down voted in the same way )
4	that editorialized headline is a mouthful and a lot of people like to upvote stories without reading the articles ( not just a reddit problem of course ) basically , the article says a blogger pretending to be kicked off the flotilla was exposed as a phony some intern who worked ( for money ? ) for the government liked the video and posted it on his twitter and the government website ( unnamed , no link ) supposedly gave a link to this fake gay guy 's blog when the government found out that it was a hoax , they took it down like any grown up organization would do and apoligized for being tricked when anti israel groups found out it was a hoax , they crucified israel for not having <> <> hindsight when some intern posted some inconsequential shit on a twitter account so who 's blowing things out of proportion how is this a big deal ? tldr read the article it 's not that big a deal
6	i'm not surprised hasbara overdrive !
6	quite surprised to see this in the uk 's conservative house magazine the torygraph
5	the arabs stole it from the crusaders ( http en wikipedia org wiki kingdom of jerusalem ) the crusaders stole it from the etc etc ad infinitum
6	why do we immediately turn to goebbels when we think of propaganda ? it was a jew , edward bernays , who wrote the bible on the subject ( literally titled " propaganda " , <> ) the psychological manipulation of the masses came from the people who mastered psychology goebbels was just a copycat hack
4	indeed this hoax makes der ewige jude look like a romantic comedy
6	on not really for example the daily mail is not a nationalised institution in the uk yet it is responsible for a significant proportion of the nationalist propaganda in the uk the norm also should be for government to not endorse hoaxes what you think they deserve a cookie and a glass of milk for this ? what credible government endorses hoaxes ? the quality of this submission is a separate issue
6	the video was very professionally made , using an actor it would n't surprise me if it was government funded in some way
4	omar could have been doing it himself , or he could have been funded i do n't know i would like to know who is going to check his bank records ?
6	conquer of lands goes back <> years the land swapped hands <> times why is the second last time the determining time ? the " theft " to which you refer happened in <> <> in <> it is as relevant as the " theft " of the land from the jews <> years ago do you think israel should cease to exist ?
2	is it so bad to have one democracy in the middle east where you can be gay openly and not killed instantly ? ah , the popular " tu quoque " ( http en wikipedia org wiki tu quoque ) argument , this is a logical fallacy false it is an intentional tactic of israeli government itself to highlight gay rights in israel and to portray it as a utopia for homosexuals in contrast with a portrayal of the arab states as being backwards and discriminatory they leave out the violence against the gay community and gay parades in israel basically israel is using homosexuals as a political football to try to score human rights brownie points since it 's impossible to do that via the central conflict between israel and the palestinians is israel using gay rights to excuse its policy on palestine ? " the accusations stem from efforts over the past half decade by the israeli government to weave the country 's gay friendly policies including national hate crime laws , employment protection for lgbt workers and openly gay military service into its larger national rebranding strategy , in the hopes of redirecting its global image away from politics , terrorism and the occupied territories " is israel using gay rights to excuse its policy on palestine ? by david kaufman , time magazine is it so bad to have one democracy in the middle east where you can be gay openly and not killed instantly ? your claims are completely false , and fabricated beirut gay pride parade http www fanoos com country beirut gay parade html gay pride parade in beirut http www network54 com forum <> thread <> last <> gay pride parade in beirut there have been gay rights protests in beirut , period therefore your claim which specifically says it ca n't happen anywhere in the middle east is <> false and really things are n't that different in israel than in the arab world there was a terror attack against the gay rights center in tel aviv which " mysteriously " has never been solved and virtually every year there are threats against the israeli pride parades and violence " a religious jew stabbed three people during clashes between dozens of ultra orthodox jews and thousands of gay pride parade marchers in central jerusalem thursday " violence erupts at gay pride parade ( http www ynetnews com articles <> , <> , l <> , <> html ) " noah satat , <> , the outspoken director of jerusalem open house , organizer of the parade who has also received death threats , is now guarded by a <> hour police escort a jerusalem gay pride clash is averted ( http www time com time world article <> , <> , <> , <> html ) " still , the ultra orthodox and the gay community have been known to come to physical blows ( http www time com time world article <> , <> , <> , <> html ) gay activists recall the <> pride march in jerusalem , when an ultra orthodox man leaped into the crowd and stabbed three marchers before he could be restrained by police the violence came after the city 's ultra orthodox mayor had tried to ban the march but was overruled in court the following year , police ordered <> , <> officers to protect a few hundred marchers from possible ultra orthodox violence " gay vs orthodox a deadly turn in israel 's culture war ? there are no laws against homosexuality in jordan for <> years long before it became legal in israel long before it became legal in most western countries , in fact in practice , in israel , tolerance of homosexuality declines precipitously once one leaves tel aviv its much like lebanon in that regard the differences in countries laws against homosexuality has less to do with inherent qualities of jews vs arabs after all the jewish religion calls for death by stoning of gays but instead has more to do with the colonial history what s interesting is that the arab areas that were once controlled by the french , like lebanon , are the ones with laws against homosexuality , because the french felt comfortable talking about sex , mr luongo said , while the areas controlled by the british didn t have those laws because they didn t talk about sex as a result , flowing from that french history is a relative familiarity with homosexuality in places like lebanon you have more gay life where the laws exist against it http travel nytimes com <> <> <> travel <> html this argument that claims that israel is the only " safe haven " for gays in the middle east used way too much to pander to western audience 's hearts " the accusations stem from efforts over the past half decade by the israeli government to weave the country 's gay friendly policies including national hate crime laws , employment protection for lgbt workers and openly gay military service into its larger national rebranding strategy , in the hopes of redirecting its global image away from politics , terrorism and the occupied territories " http www time com time world article <> , <> , <> , <> html " israel has begun an aggressive public relations campaign to market itself as an oasis of gay tolerance and democracy in the mideast , surrounded by backward countries where gays have no rights the campaign is not about supporting queers in palestine or elsewhere in the mideast who are resisting homophobia it is about using their experience of homophobia to promote hatred of palestinians , arabs , and muslims including queer palestinians , arabs , and muslims the campaign is designed to make people living in liberal democracies like canada feel an affinity for israel the implication is that israel needs to practice apartheid , colonialism , and violence in order to preserve the liberal freedoms it enjoys it might be unpleasant , but surely we can understand the exceptional circumstances ?

1	fuck off you filthy disgusting sandnigger
1	can we kill him now ? i mean the man has said it himself that he will once again become a global menace if given enough breathing room so let 's just take the fucker out and end this war once and for all
1	can we stop upvoting this please it 's baseless drum pounding what the hell is he going to do ? bomb countries thousands of miles from his country with his magical air force ? it 's not our fight , they have to sort it out themselves so it turns out france have been arming the rebels that 's great another term for rebels is insurgents so why are we on one side of the fence in libya and another in afganistan ? we need to get the fuck out of the middle east and concentrate on sorting our own countries out before we all go bankrupt edit downvote , away ! if you genuinely think you are better off as we pour tax money into bombing countries we 've never been to before , you must be the luckiest person alive ! i would rather spend our money on doctors , teachers , firefighters , nurses , local police , childcare and disease prevention
4	remember guys take everything with a grain of salt amnesty international never did find evidence of the mass rapes or mercenary armies or air strikes and really it just sounds like more talk which dictators do best they lied to get you to go along with iraq they will lie to you to get you to support another conflict yes he is an asshole but saddam was too and we gave him the weapons to attack iran the west sold weapons to gaddafi as well it is not good vs bad it is just foreign policy and it is time for libya to liberalize http i imgur com mupff jpg
1	interview with gaddafi 's son ( http www youtube com watch ? v rpmugpqc4zy & feature channel video title ) the whole lybia thing is a coup basicly in the guise of a humanitarian help plan it is trying to destroy the powers of lybia for special interests do n't believe the story about soldiers raping woman and gaddafi suposedly giving out condoms neither should you believe this gaddafi does not have the technology to send a missiles to europe its pure bullshit and for fuck sake people be skepticle for once , not all news is true infact most is propaganda especially the american news , you guys seem to be unable to learn from your mistakes
3	he cooperated with the war on terror , and refused to allow al qaeda into libya he 's not a good man , but he is not a monster he did not launch strikes against america or europe , it is america and europe that started the war against him
3	i live in italy and basically gadhafi has tried to bomb italian soil for more than a decade ( none of the bombs reached our territory ) the things he is saying somehow resembles the things saddam used to say about " the mother of all battles " basically , gadhafi is one desperate man trying to mantain power for as long as possible , brainwashing his weak supporters and promote " democracy ? ! freedom ? ! " with fear etc i do not necessarily agree with the presence of nato troops , aircrafts in lybia but it is a " necessary evil " ( like hobbes used to say ) he and his men has killed , tortured , molested , destroyed families , homes and hopes nato is there to establish peace and remove another dangerous mind from this infected reality the fact that he threathens europe somehow makes me laugh the only way he could reach the west is by promoting terror but a war ? ? naaaah
1	i hope they see reason and just take out infrastructure like a couple of bridges and some locks and avoids casualties if gaddafi attacks europe then the anti war movement would die out immediately every single european would support a full scale retaliation against gaddafi until he 's in the fucking ground
6	hey i read an article that president obama helped this girl meet justin beiber after she wrote a letter to him why do n't you ask him to hook you up and nuke gaddafi so you can get some hot , killing machine action ?
8	i didnt know families made homes in radar stations and tanks do you have any idea who you 're feeling sorry for ? it is amazing how people will completely ignore the crimes commited by tyrants if it means expressing your bias against the west by going on about imaginary deaths or exaggerating unfortunate incidents involving the west disgusting
1	but he 's the bad guy ? gaddafi is attempting to exterminate his own people via mass genocide his forces have gang raped thousands of women , children , and infants it 's hard to find a libyan who has n't lost someone at the hands of gaddafi 's brutality so yes , he is the bad guy can you fuck with that logic now ?
4	it is n't about helping some poor rebels or anything like that but it is of course there are always ulterior motives involved in human conflicts i'm sure oil is one of them but that does not change the fact that innocent civilians are being systematically hunted down by gaddafi forces and raped or murdered the libyan population is united in their opposition to gaddafi and they will not stop until the man is gone they asked us for help and we obliged
7	gaddafi 's response to protesters ( http en wikipedia org wiki <> libyan civil war treatment of protests ) " the libyan government employed snipers , artillery , helicopter gunships , warplanes , anti aircraft weaponry , and warships against demonstrations and funeral processions , and security forces repeatedly fired at protesters with live ammunition amnesty international reported that writers , intellectuals and other prominent opposition sympathizers disappeared during the early days of the conflict in gaddafi controlled cities , and that they may have been subjected to torture or execution " " amnesty international also reported that security forces targeted paramedics helping injured protesters in multiple incidents , gaddafi 's forces were documented using ambulances in their attacks injured demonstrators were sometimes denied access to hospitals and ambulance transport the government also banned giving blood transfusions to people who had taken part in the demonstrations security forces , including members of gaddafi 's revolutionary committees , stormed hospitals and removed the dead injured protesters were either summarily executed or had their oxygen masks , iv drips , and wires connected to the monitors removed " " military commanders summarily executed soldiers who refused to fire on protesters the international federation for human rights reported a case where <> soldiers were executed some of the soldiers executed by their commanders were burned alive " " the international federation for human rights concluded that gaddafi is implementing a strategy of scorched earth and seeks to eliminate and suppress libyan citizens who stood up against his regime " " human rights groups and aid workers had previously documented rapes by loyalist fighters during the war , including the rape of children some of the children raped were as young as eight aid workers reported that some children were being forced to watch their mothers raped and their fathers killed , before being beaten some of the rape victims were reportedly infected with hiv "
3	they started off protesting in mid feburary peacefully until gaddafi soldiers started violently cracking down like i said , storming a military barracks armory is not a mark of a peaceful protest after that , the protestors started getting violent violent peaceful protestors pathetic they only turned to foreign powers after realizing they could not take on gaddafi 's entire military head on this makes them traitors and should be killed off nothing worse than traitors also , back to the op , gaddafi was always a monster labelling someone a " monster " is childish he chose supported sides that you disagreed with that 's life i honestly doubt he helped us with terrorism out of the kindness from his heart more to improve economic relations with the world you make it sound like this is a bad thing in politics , there is only self interest nothing more , nothing less
3	because the " rebels " have overtaken most of the towns with the help of nato and the people fear if they show support in those towns they will be killed source ? and the msm hiding this fact source ? so the people supporting gaddafi in the video are supporting him because they lost their family members source ?
6	europe is part of nato bub they have veto power under your argument all nations need permission from a mythological " international community " to take action in their national interests but let 's play your game why should china have veto power on the right of another nation to act in its own best interests ?
4	i do not support the rebels for a number of reasons , one of them being the likelihood of a return to islamic fundamentalism to libya should the rebels win qaddafi has resorted to strong arm tactics and brutality to maintain power and control over the entirety of libya over the last <> years however , the likelihood of a genocide or large scale massacre in response to the rebellion is small and serves only as pro war speculation and propaganda as for your rhetorical abuse of rwanda do stop we had peacekeepers in place in rwanda , and they could have at least greatly reduced the numbers of casualties simply by making their presence known via numerous patrols the situation compares not at all to libya , in which the west is taking advantage of internal turmoil to pursue its geopolitical goals that is not at all worthy of praise what is most frustrating about us nato wars dating from the intervention in the former yugoslavia is that there is always a group of useful idiots willing to swallow the propaganda and lend the wars domestic support remember that next time a republican administration starts a war and the republicans follow blindly
4	outrageous ! he is threatening to copy standard us operating procedure in iraq and afghanistan does n't he understand that only nato has the right to conduct house to house searches ? however , i did manage to find evidence ( http www sott net articles show <> muammar gaddafi calls on libyans to resist colonialists ) of unanimous support within libya for western intervention " these were ordinary people , asleep in their homes , not soldiers , " one man shouted " where is democracy when they are killing children ? " cried another , gesturing at the infant 's fresh grave " the people who did this are the terrorists , shedding the blood of innocent muslims " oh wait he was railing against the nato bombing that had killed his <> month old niece however " no one knows how this will end , " said a worried taxi driver , negotiating the eerily empty streets " but this is an internal libyan problem the french and british should understand that people are afraid of these cruise missiles " oh maybe i'm not good at this i 'll just shut off my brain and tune into cnn later to find out what my opinion should be thanks for the help
6	like i said , i agree that there are probably ulterior motives including oil but how exactly does that change the fact that gaddafi is a crazed fascist who is currently attempting to eradicate his own people ? what do you propose ? stand idle and watch him commit mass genocide ? how come the us is n't in somalia , congo , hell , how many nations in africa could use the dire help the west is giving libya ? because the arab spring never reached africa the people there are n't revolting against their governments on the same magnitude as in libya
3	but how exactly does that change the fact that gaddafi is a crazed fascist who is currently attempting to eradicate his own people ? holy moly that 's one loaded sentence if there was an uprising in america , would the group be labeled rebels or terrorists ? would the attempt to squash this rebellion be called " eradication " or " attempt to restore peace and order " ? i guess it would depend on who controlled the media , right ? do you think that nato and the us would help libya if it did n't have any oil ? the us was secretly helping the rebels just two three weeks after they started the " rebellion " without that help , they probably would n't have gotten as much control as they did without that much control , gaddafi probably would n't use as much violence to stop them you sound like the kind of guy who will blindly accept anything bad about gaddafi without asking yourself if it is just war propaganda
1	wait , so he threatens to bomb homes and families , whilst we are actively doing it but he 's the bad guy ? just ca n't fuck with that logic
4	wow a " downvoted because it 's too radical left " comment i actually agree with do n't see that every day
4	it would wake people up to the fact that the world has become to small to feel invulnerable to threats from far away and how stupid it is to allow their governments to just attack other people for what ever reason they see fit i hope they see reason and just take out infrastructure like a couple of bridges and some locks and avoids casualties
6	why ? seriously , why do you think we should give mali veto power on killing a guy that has pledged to murder our citizens ? it is in our national interest , not to mention that of libya why would we need the permission of every tinpot dictatorship in the world ?
4	with threats like thay i think it is safe to say national security is allowed to override some fragile international will
8	nef beat me to it , those mass rape reports were false , like the throwing babies out of incubator stories in gulf war v1 <> no one is paying attention to racial cleansing done by the rebels though are they , sorry , i mean cia funded freedom fighters enjoy your fox news
5	we ca n't relate to the suffering we are causing you got it the wrong way you ca n't relate to the suffering that is happening there at the hands of gaddafi the man is a lunatic fascist that is hell bent on eliminating anyone who questions his authority few countries have shown this level of open aggression against its own population , not even burma or north korea are doing the kind of shit that gaddafi is currently pulling the libyan population begged us for help as they were being butchered what kind of sick person is going to say no and just watch another rwanda unfold ? the only right action would have been to decapitate the regime day one that 's what they tried but sadly gaddafi is a hard man to kill
4	after reading your posts i realized that you 're like a walking , talking propaganda machine edit there are these people in afghanistan and iraq that have been known to rape innocent people ( http www youtube com watch ? v t3w2mgq7v3q ) , killing innocent civilians ( http www alternet org world <> u s accused of killing <> civilians in afghanistan airstrike ) when bombing them the us and nato should send in an army to fight these bastards ! oh shit
4	you are so naive if libya did n't have oil nato and the us would n't bother to help them even if they asked you would n't even know if they 'd ask for help how come the us is n't in somalia , congo , hell , how many nations in africa could use the dire help the west is giving libya ? because they already have the leaders they want in those nations or the nation does n't have any valuable resources it literally has nothing to do with helping some rebels it 's all about oil they only play the innocent civilians angle to convince people like you that they should be in this war
1	it is not that i really want it to happen , i can understand that it would happen and i hope that it would remind people on how bad war actually is if someone starts hitting you i would only think it normal that you started fighting back so he stops doing that we live in fear of terrorist strikes and are all to keen to send people out to ruin the lives of people in other countries we ca n't relate to the suffering we are causing yes plenty of people will be angry when shit hits the fan but that anger will subside and make people wiser if interfering in an other countries affairs had been ok the only right action would have been to decapitate the regime day one now we are making libya poor for no reason what so ever
4	your issue seems to be more with the fact that your country is in the un the very reason for the un 's existence is to provide methods of diplomacy and to prevent war , which is why permanent members have the right to veto countries do n't need to be a part of the un but if they join they need to accept the rules it 's just like any other club , society or organisation
1	as retarded as he may be , gaddafi gives not a single fuck
4	in <> , after coming to power and confronted with the evidence of us assassination plots in various parts of the world , president lyndon johnson famously stated that the us was operating a damned murder , inc in <> , the church committee , which conducted the senate investigations into cia assassination plots , concluded that a policy of assassination violates moral precepts fundamental to our way of life an executive order issued in the wake of the committee explicitly barred the practice there was , of course , never a golden age of american imperialism however , the past <> years have witnessed a collapse of any pretense of legality and a democratic accountability a policy of state killing is the culmination of a process that includes unending wars of aggression , torture , detention without charge , and the erosion of democratic rights in the united states itself this has been closely bound up with the transformation of social relations within the us , the rise of a parasitic financial aristocracy and the extraordinary growth of social inequality policies like pursuing gaddafi s assassination as military strategy will have profound consequences the obama administration and the american ruling class have established their willingness to extra judicially kill anyone they view as an obstacle it is not only a warning , moreover , to political organizations or heads of state in foreign countries there can be no doubt that us government personnel would utilize similar measures against any significant domestic opposition
6	what do they have at this point ?
3	no his own people have been subjugated to gaddafi 's regime for decades and have been imprisoned , censored , etc they started off protesting in mid feburary peacefully until gaddafi soldiers started violently cracking down after that , the protestors started getting violent they only turned to foreign powers after realizing they could not take on gaddafi 's entire military head on http www youtube com watch ? v vaclhhhv43s also , back to the op , gaddafi was always a monster http en wikipedia org wiki gaddafi state sponsored terrorism i honestly doubt he helped us with terrorism out of the kindness from his heart more to improve economic relations with the world
3	please stop making up stuff the video was not made by me tripoli is the last remaining pro gadaffi bastion because the " rebels " have overtaken most of the towns with the help of nato and the people fear if they show support in those towns they will be killed the rest of the country are risking their lives daily to stop him the video portrays a different picture and the msm hiding this fact does not increases my confidence in that viewpoint at this point almost every libyan has directly lost family members to gaddafi 's regime , they will not stop until he pays in blood so the people supporting gaddafi in the video are supporting him because they lost their family members point taken
4	such an american view of the world as a european , even if he attacked us , i would n't support the war why ? it 's another oil war it is n't about helping some poor rebels or anything like that it 's just about oil i also love the way you see things do n't support a war against him ? then you must support a war against us ! it 's not like you can be against both !
1	if gaddafi attacks europe then the anti war movement would die out immediately every single european would support a full scale retaliation against gaddafi until he 's in the fucking ground which is why gaddafi might probably only do that if he 's clearly going to lose in a few days
4	he openly said on international tv that he was planning on going " from house to house , killing every single rebel in benghazi " people like you are the reason rwanda happened
6	no , it 's not the surprise factor most human beings would feel renewed sorrow that so much pointless carnage has been done under the banner of a flag that so many we know have fought and died for but is being used now for only greed , empire and political careers you miss the moral point and the political point wars are not supposed to kill civilians , it 's basically illegal as attested to by civilized nations ' promulgation of the geneva conventions and other protocols on war over more than a century even worse you totally miss the point that killing saddam hussein and tens of thousands , if not hundreds of thousands , of iraqi civilians was not " a war " it was an invasion based on a lie you do not feel outrage because you 're cool with people losing their lives for nothing there is no real moral or political correlation between wwii and the us invasion of iraq " my god " ? you have a god ? odin ? zeus ? the old testament hairy thunderer ?
3	you know they are counting the people that the terrorists and insurgents are killing in reprisal also does not consider the number of people who were dying on a daily basis during the saddam era ( do you think he 'd let this whole ' arab spring ' thing just slide by ? )
6	sometimes numbers are wrong what 's your point , that it does n't matter that tons of civilians are killed if we do n't know exactly how many ? are you saying america has done no harm to the people of iraq ?
4	it 's an outlier in comparison to most studies done on iraqi war casualties that 's not exactly true the only other peer reviewed study with a reasonably good methodology that was done on the subject was violence related mortality in iraq from <> to <> ( http dx doi org <> <> <> ) , which was based on the iraq family health survey the other " studies " you 're talking about are n't actual studies on the subject , but estimates arrived at either through fundamentally flawed methodologies or through studies focusing on entirely different subjects unfortunately , the iraq family health survey suffers from a number of fundamental flaws as well one such flaw is that it used government affiliated interviewers to gather data , leading to a high chance of biased reports , primarily from families who either opposed the government themselves or whose deceased family members opposed the government other major flaws include the fact that some <> of planned samples were not taken due to safety concerns , and an inability to interview those families in the planned sample that had dissolved or fled due to violence that 's not to say that the two lancet studies were perfect they definitely were n't , if only because gathering data in a war torn country tends to be hard but they were at least on par with the iraq family health survey , and a good argument can be made that they were better however , one thing to keep in mind is that the relevant result was n't the estimate , but the <> confidence interval for the <> study , this was <> , <> to <> , <> a rather wide range
6	i was surprised and depressed by the civillian casualties so many people who were just trying to live their lives have been killed because of these wars
4	the funny thing is how we ( serbia ) are constantly blamed as a nation for committing horrible war atrocities in the <> ( which we did ) we arrested ratko mladic , dubbed war criminal and genocidal man who killed several thousand muslim men , yet former and current us president are free despite the fact that they are directly responsible for many , many more deaths
6	quarter of a million human beings dead , and for what ? what have we gained ? a hatred throughout the middle east ? statist pigs
4	i'm so glad i pay for murder
6	i mean how does this really surprise anyone ? wars cost money , wars kill people the magnitude is actually lower than i figured it would be seriously , if you want some statistics that will make your head spin , look up operation barbarossa from wwii my god
4	wait , just yesterday it was a million wow ! <> , <> people resurrected in a day thanks to the power of reddit ! i remember when the sanctions on iraq killed a million children just how many people are there in iraq , and how many times has each of them been killed by american atrocities ?
2	do n't forget , they hate us for our " freedom "
1	this is so fucked up , we should be killing people more efficiently
2	the number may even be higher during the bombing period of the invasion a lot of infrastructure was destroyed and much of the paper records have been lost these estimates of civilian casualties rely on reported deaths , that is people whose identity could be confirmed and were actually reported to hospitals and medics those that cannot be recognized are often left in a limbo of non existence or if the description fits called enemy combatants also a great deal of deaths go unreported during the bombing campaing the estimates may have also been a lot higher as not a whole lot is left in the aftermath of a <> or <> ton bomb , those bombs leave craters the size of city blocks whatever gets hit by it gets pulverized the army and government use those conservative estimates mostly to tune down the severity of the conflict but as it turn out reality has a darker hue
1	well maybe if we had n't been giving osama guns and money to kill soviets in the first place , that mother fucker would n't have been able to turn on us later its gonna be the same story in libya we are helping the " rebels " and they will turn out to be the same kind of " rebel " osama was the u s has military bases all over the planet and many people do n't want us there how would you like it if a soldier with an automatic weapon who did n't even speak your language kicked in the door of your home , put you and your children on the floor at gunpoint and then looked through your wifes panty drawer for guns ? i assume you would want to buy them a beer ?
2	alright , you seem to infer a lot about my political beliefs based on very little i admit that i'm a little jaded because i 've been hearing similar statistics at various points over the last decade they are absolutely appalling , and do not deserve to be so casually brushed off as i just did do n't misunderstand me i detest the bush administration with every fiber of my being for their decisions with regards to iraq alone , not to mention every single blunder which surrounded it and all the fallout thereafter i apologize for not really thinking my post through very well , and offending you in the process i genuinely agree with you , and i am not being sarcastic in the slightest bit in return , however , i would ask that you refrain from making uninformed and clearly anger driven assessments of other people which you have no evidence to support indirectly claiming the person you are arguing against is a sociopath does not convince them of anything it simply makes them more inclined to argue with you for the sake of arguing its a shame when someone makes a good point which is completely lost on its audience because they want to disagree sidebar i do n't exactly know what you expected to add with your last couple sentences i said " my god , " for emphasis , and i think most people would get that given the context
6	why are we in iraq ? when did american involvement in iraq start ? be specific
2	yeah , thats why these goat herders keep trying to blow stuff up in our cities because they hate their leaders
4	i have n't seen it mentioned , but the article clearly goes into the different dogs that have been called riot dog thanks though
4	it was like a mini documentary !
2	we are facing the same problem in libya as afghanistan we have a government in power that we know is repressive and will support international terrorism we have a force trying to overthrow it that is marginally capable of running the country and will probably not be on our side when the dust settles help either side and we 're going to be hated and reviled do nothing and we 're going to be hated and reviled
4	thank you !
2	as someone who actually works in music publishing and the music industry you are completely full of shit this " neither the riaa or any major distributors of music in the western world do n't pay artists " is absolutely ridiculous i collect royalties for my clients every single quarter from them , and it is meaningful if people actually buy the music instead of make up bullshit excuses not to
2	the us government gives way less of a shit about people outside the us than your own citizens , this is why large chunks of the world does n't like your country , they repeatedly pull bullshit like that ( or much worse ) for the benefit of the us at much larger expense to other people , that and the very vocal dumb minority
4	http timesofindia indiatimes com world uk osama plot <> <> type strike in smaller cities like la articleshow <> cms http www fas org irp congress <> rpt staff statement <> pdf " he met with bin laden to discuss the targets the world trade center , which represented the u s economy the pentagon , a symbol of the u s military and the u s capitol , the perceived source of u s policy in support of israel the white house was also on the list , as bin laden considered it a political symbol and wanted to attack it as well "
4	that makes perfect sense thanks
1	yep there was a memo you must have missed it they issued it sometime after september <> now shut the fuck up your sounding kinda muslim y and unamerican
1	i was saying this as <> happened when i was <> years old , conveniently in an international relations class taking a building or two down with an airplane is not how terrorism works terrorist always have a point to what they do , and very rarely that point is simply ' fuck you ' look at fidel castro , he 's a rebel , a terrorist , a revolutionary or the classic ira true terrorism tries to at least has a point and tries to change something osama bin laden was n't dumb and would n't make himself a target and now martyr just for a few buildings with zero point to doing it , it does n't make sense !
4	a single person boycotting an institution would not ( likely ) destroy it , but even such a seemingly small act does " hurt it " by definition , if an institution does n't get money that it would otherwise get , then it has been " hurt , " in your words even if that amount is a penny and trying to make it sound like something is hopeless just so you can justify your apathy or lack of effort is pretty terrible , in my opinion you should n't give your money to a company that does things you disapprove of , no matter exactly how large the impact will be on it 's bottom line doing something because it 's right , not because it 's significant , is pretty much the definition of integrity
1	so basically your only guarantee under the constitution you 're all so proud of is that they wo n't directly restrict your speech indirectly , they 'll do whatever the fuck they want , same as always
6	why would n't other treaties count also ? for example i'm sure we have a treaty with european nations about security nato intelligence gather etc ?
4	hurr durr , assange giving bradley a large sum of money would not look good at manning 's trial , there is no connection between manning and assange they would like to keep it that way until the trial is over
4	instead of downvoting , prove me wrong i did n't downvote you , but i would like to say that you ca n't disprove an opinion nearly all of what you said is opinion that ca n't be proved or disproved
4	i think assange is a difficult personality , but wikileaks has made significant impact with him at the helm this is an undeniable fact i would agree that assange is calculating , however , i see this as a positive quality he is fighting people that are authoring all sorts of brutalities , and i would personally want the biggest cunt in the universe fighting for my interests rather than against them politics is a very dirty game expecting assange to be a saint here is ludicrous i think there 's a big difference between liking and respecting a person and acknowledging their success assange is not very likeable , but he is highly effective at what he does i hope he continues being a prick , because it 's obviously working for him ( and us )
4	everyone responding to posts like this with a serious comment , you 're most likely encouraging trolls
6	what a douche
4	funny story about visa mastercard their president wants to be responsable for destroying hard currency before he was president of visa mastercard , he was president of nestle where he wanted to gain control of the world 's entire potable water supply ruminate on the implications of this
4	i find julian assange a very calculating and scheming man , not to mention greedy he promised bradley manning money for his defence , in reality he gave him a miserly <> , <> , in the situation he is in , that is nothing if wikileaks were under better leadership it could do more good than it is right at this minute in time as it stands , by not delivering on his promises and being the media whore he is assange is making wikileaks look nothing more than the worlds biggest blackmailing scheme edit instead of downvoting , prove me wrong
4	well , they do , but the things they admit to are actually legal in the united states ( and in fact in all western countries ) last time there was a situation like this ( watergate scandal ) , eventually the president at the time ( nixon ) had to resign , whilst the new york time still exists to this day
4	it 'll be a hell of a lot more handy than an encrypted file that <> previous owners said was " just like real money "
6	if someone is under investigation i'm all for preventing them access to their money however , what happened here is that visa shut down their accounts and took all their money without even a single charge filed against wikileaks why has n't wikileaks been charged with anything in the us ? probably because they have n't done anything illegal
6	good i hope wikileaks wins what visa and mastercard did was a blatant and obscene violation of free speech they should be ashamed of themselves for acting in such an atrocious manner and i feel a draconian punishment for corporations who act this way is more than appropriate
6	that would be great if visa mastercard were n't two of the largest players in credit debit card transaction networks they are stopping millions ( billions ? ) of people from donating to an organisation that does n't appear to have broken a law and has certainly not been charged and tried with such visa mc are blocking payments to wikileaks so , if i wanted to , i ca n't use my visa debit card to donate to them , neither could i use my mastercard credit card why ca n't i choose where my money goes ? i ca n't really choose not to have a visa card , either all of the uk banks seem to be issuing visa debit cards these days when you 're a monopoly or part of a oligopoly , you should n't be able to choose who you deal with this is assuming that visa mc are doing it out of their own volition and not if the us government is telling them what to do that 's the problem when you have american dominance in important industries the us government tries to use them to implement their laws outside their borders i am not a us citizen , wikileaks ( iirc ) is not a us organisation , so why is the us government stopping me from donating my ( non us ) money to them ?
4	( d ) apply dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties , thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage that would be it right there they are refusing to allow transactions to this company for no reason that is applying dissimilar conditions ( i e your company cannot be these two cause we dont like you ) and thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage
6	what wikileaks did was considered illegal no , it was n't certainly not by eu ( or any member country ) law , and arguably not by us law and nothing has been proven in any court , so it 's all speculative
6	what wikileaks did was considered illegal who by ?
6	when you have that sort of exclusivity in banking and money you create an even bigger divide between the haves and the have nots what can you do when no institution will allow you to have wages paid into your account or bills to be paid through your account ?
4	i live in texas , ( i know bad karma already ) but here you cant deny service because of race or color , but you can for just not liking somone its the same for big companies i 'll say this , one the one hand , if the us suggested they do it , its not illigal , but in poor taste just like when wikileaks took documents marked secret and higher and published them to the world , in several instances putting troops in afganistan ( not just american troops ) at risk not illigal , but in poor taste
4	christ it 's people like you that lower the general level of discourse on reddit i do n't even refer to the nature or validity of the comment just the manner of your rebuke is such tripe that i think do n't votes do n't express enough
3	i only downvoted you because of your edit insults and whining do n't add anything back on topic al qaeda has claimed responsibility for numerous acts which caused injury , loss of life , and serious damage to others ' properties it 's hard to call them much other than a religiously fanatical terrorist organization i would define wikileaks as a whistle blowing support organization i think their role is similar , if not exactly identical to , the role the new york times played for ellsberg when it published the pentagon papers would you say that the new york times ' funds should have been frozen and or their accounts closed ? how then could they have afforded legal counsel to fight the charges made by the government ?
4	so the u s state department can make and enforce their own laws now ? did i miss a new <> branch of government memo ? is this like monopoly where the u s state department says something and you skip go and go directly to jail ?
1	i'm so glad to hear this what they did was a fucking u s led cartel this was the creepiest , most disturbing thing the american government has done in the past <> years
4	i did n't realize european visa was <> european owned when i posted if they are eu only , then that will likely mean that it will be european laws about cooperation with the u s and european banking regulations topics i know little about
2	i hate to be that guy , but its allowed , not aloud
4	hmm thanks for that post i just learned something visa europe is owned , controlled and operated by its members more than <> , <> banks and other payment service providers in <> countries across europe we are the payment industry s only pan european membership association our members decide on our strategic direction , our investments and our innovations i'm not sure how the u s could stop them from taki8ng non u s payments from non americans my guess is that european governments must be involved
5	if it goes through , my faith in europe will continue my faith in humanity , sadly , remains unchanged
2	those are n't creepy they 're geopolitical calculations done out of rage ( afghanistan ) and cold manipulation of facts ( iraq ) neither is really disturbing more disgusting
1	if they want my business , they do the only way we , as a nation , can stop the trampling of our civil liberties by the wealthy is by holding them accountable for their misbehavior be it with my dollar votes or though court order , when they fuck up and do something that is blatantly abusive society must hold them accountable
1	not entirely true under eu law , companies that have a de facto dominant position in a market are required to go beyond respecting the letter of eu law they are required to exercise " social responsibility " ( whatever the fuck that means ) due to the potential negative effects of their market dominance
4	this reminds me of how i wish i could financially support the hacker groups when they hack into something i enjoy ! does anyone else feel this urge ? i like what the majority of those groups were doing and i wanted to financially support it
1	fuck wkileaks that website is the worst website out there , its worse than the westboro baptist church , and coming from a marine who 's e had them arrive at a funeral i was at thats saying something that shit is n't public knowledge for a good reason

4	i agree i really think the us response to wikileaks was a bit like someone driving a car and being stung by a bee rather than calmly pull over , we just started flipping shit and swerving all over the road
4	it will be interesting like a lot of other people , i have mixed feelings about wikileaks i'm glad to know a lot of the leaks but i also understand why we have classified data and why we cooperate with allies when its a u s company involved
8	ah , sorry , i was locked in another mindset and overreacted
4	i lold because try and seed anything that is n't fl byebye good luck
4	i agree and disagree with you here i think that , on a moral level , you are completely correct but i think that on another level , you have the government flipping shit about some website airing their dirty laundry and acting in a way that , at the spur of the moment ( read without thinking for <> seconds ) they thought would protect them from bad shit coming about as a result all and all just a poorly handled mess that made us look like fools in about <> different ways
3	trying to strike fear does n't make you a terrorist , using fear to effect change is what makes you one
6	he said meaningful ( http www techdirt com articles <> <> shtml ) <> <> is a slap in the face , nothing else edit curses ! why is my link not showing ? http www techdirt com articles <> <> shtml
6	okay i 'll take your bet go to what cd , and download any torrent with <> seeder wo n't be under <> seconds
3	i deleted it because i misread osama for obama , hilarious eh ? why so srs ? and believe what you want about the sniper dude , he did n't have a clear motive and no friends to support him , he was a rogue psycho which by nature induces fear he is a terrorist in the same sense a rabid dog is a terrorist
2	i think the part that gets to people is that it shows corporations like visa mastercard really can get whatever they want , they can pass whatever laws they need to kill competition , and can use their power to screw over the consumers ( us ) the government should work for the people , not for the multi million dollar corporations
1	sure , but when they overstep looking out for their citizens interests and actively make other peoples lives worse just at the expense of making americans lives marginally better off , they lose any damn respect from me that is completely immoral and makes my blood boil they 're like the ultimate school yard bullies , and who the fuck likes them ?
1	is n't protecting a nation 's citizens and interests the government 's main , if not sole , reason for being ? yes and no the government should protect the citizens ' interests this is not what is happening it protecting solely a few big corporations , those with political power so the government is only protecting itself , and the other citizens can go an fuck themselves also , slapping a label on it hey it 's just realpolitik , or power politics does n't make it right
2	i'm not sure why you 're being downvoted it may not be popular on reddit , i may hate it myself , but that is how the law operates as long as the doj is trying to pin assange , i do n't this case going anywhere visa and master card have <> and <> percent of the market share in europe i also do n't expect a whole lot in going after the payment processing monopoly i hope wikileaks the best , but if you really want to support wikileaks and hurt visa and mastercard , start using bitcoin and donate that way
6	has any member of wikileaks been proven guilty and convicted of any crime that you speak of in a court of law ? innocent until proven guilty another fantastic pillar of a fair society that sets modern civilisations aside from the rest
8	he has personally protested against the treatment manning is receiving and has donated to the manning legal defense fund we just do n't get to see the degree to which he has championed mannings situation because our government still considers him an enemy of the state his hands are fairly well tied at this point wikileaks and assange acting as their spokesman can not as it would compromise their objectivity it is a tricky situation do n't expect anything to come from wikileaks front page unless some clear evidence is handed to them that they can publish edit sorry should have been more clear about whether i was talking about assange the man or assange the spokesman
8	sorry , i'm not convinced i 'd still take the <> billion gold reserves in fort knox over your matabele gumbo beads any day , which are backed by who or what exactly ?
4	allofmp3 com was like a russian itunes type site they sold music for about <> cents a song they also offered a variety of formats including lossless flac formats they paid royalties to rom which is the russian equivelent of the riaa however the riaa were unhappy because although they were paying the correct amount of royalites required under russian law the riaa wanted more so they refused to even collect the royalties that had been paid to roms the riaa then lobbied the us government to put pressure on visa , mastercard , paypal and anyone else based in the us that offered a payment option to allofmp3 com the above is from memory so feel free to google it for more information
4	so what ? it still lists the laws that they will seek to prove visa matercard has broken these laws , which you can lookup yourself if you do n't like the linked site , show that you are talking nonsense
4	so anyone feel like storming quantico ?
4	well that 's what he 's asking has julian assange been protesting for the guy ? " helping him in any way would be seen as admission " all of a sudden assange is supposed to be worried about what people will think ? assange 's complete mo is to not care about what people think , or worry about how things will be seen , no matter what this is the only reason the guy is relevant all of a sudden he ca n't protest for fear of how that might be construed ? sounds like a double standard double standards beget more double standards , which eventually snowball into all out corruption it 's the classic slippery slope syndrome which has happened to every nation since the beginning of history the minute we start allowing him to adopt a double standard , we begin to " aid and abet " him into becoming exactly what the us government is being accused of more and more all over the world ostensibly doing what 's best for foreign entities , but actually doing what 's best for america ( oil interests , etc ) if assange does n't do exactly the utmost that he can to help bradley ( even at the cost of his own certain demise ) , then he will be operating in reaction to what does and does n't hurt himself , which equals only doing what 's in his own best interest when you start putting yourself ahead like that , you start yourself down the usual , inevitable , inexorable decline into corruption assange needs for us to give him a good shaking and say , " man ! i know things are tough , but you knew that they could get this way what you 're doing going up against one of the historically most powerful countries in the world was bound to get you in the hot water that you 're in by backing down on helping people like bradley in any way that you can , you 're simply confirming what the naysayers have been saying all along when the going gets tough , you 'll start backing down "
4	the dollar is n't backed by any real reserve of assets very few currencies probably are really so in that regard , bitcoin is just as good as the dollar
1	fuck yeah , it was about time !
1	shut the fuck up
1	chill the fuck out and shut the fuck up , bro
6	what exactly became of these funds ? did visa and mc essentially take people 's money , then keep it rather than either delivering it to the intended party or returning it ? if so , does n't that warrant some type of theft charges be filed ?
5	fantastic , fantastic news i donated with my mastercard and was sad when they blocked donations just a few days afterwards maybe my money never even reached them , how can i tell ? i wrote emails to both mc and visa to complain i got no response
1	here 's the way i look at it wikileaks is in the right they are in violation of no law , foreign or domestic , and are victims of nothing more than a government sanctioned witch hunt because the information they are leaking are damning to various powerful governments and corporations around the world i believe the charges , including the sexual assault charges , are completely trumped up and were fabricated to discredit assange and give the police a reason to detain and arrest him but i do n't blame visa , mastercard , paypal , amazon , or any of the other long list of companies that ultimately stopped providing services to him they were all under tremendous pressure from the most powerful government in the world a government that had the power completely ruin their business , arrest ceos , etc it 's no surprise that they all found any reason they could come up with to distance themselves from wikileaks it 's easy to say they should have " stood up to the government " and continued to support wikileaks from the other side of a computer screen , sitting in your chair , when there are no consequences for your words and decisions but when you 've got millions ( billions ? ) of dollars on the line , an angry government threatening anything and everything they could throw at you , pressure from stockholders , boards of directors , etc , and your personal freedom in jeopardy if you choose not to comply , i 'll bet my left nut that every single one of you would do the exact same thing that these companies did comply with government demands , cut off services to wikileaks , and distance themselves from the situation as much as they could these companies have no legal , ethical , or moral obilgation to " stick it to the man " or make any kind of political statement by continuing to support him they are in a business to make money business wise , wikileaks is battery acid they 're doing the smart thing sitting back with their popcorn and watching the shitstorm from the rafters once the political pressure from various powerful governments is removed , i'm willing to bet that these companies will continue to do business with wikileaks again if not , i 'll gladly grab my torch and pitchfork
4	other treaties may count in some sense , but the complaint is to be lodged with dg iv ( the european competition commission ) citing violation of specific eu laws with respect to abuse of a dominant market position if visa and mastercard want to argue some principle of ' greater good ' then i suppose they can if they want , but whether dg iv gives a shit about their ideas is another matter
2	a nation of people who understand their government is actively looking to twist , sabotage or subvert its own legal system in order to prosecute a man who has committed no crime disgust me
6	what sanctions did the government impose ?
4	when you set yourselves up so you become a virtual duopoly ( with a lot of international government help regulation wise ) , you should lose the right to chose who you do business with aka unless they have actually broken the law you must do business with them because there are no real other options and with way all governments are pushing for a cashless society it 's only going to get worse " morality disrepute " clauses are a joke that translate into " because we felt like it " , otherwise visa and mc would have stopped processing payments for porn and alcohol a long time ago due to the perceptions of large portions of the planet visa mc need to decide what they are , international independent financial organisations who 's only mission is facilitating payments or part of the us governments arsenal to enforce their political will internationally so then the rest of the world can decide if they want those two ( and thus the usa ) virtually running large potions of the local financial system or if they want to set up an alternative
4	most of these people seem to have never actually left the nest because they hold some seriously confused beliefs about how the world works this stuff about the usa being the most evil nation in human history is especially funny
4	no , corporations are n't alive , much less human but they act like sociopaths
1	sure , now let 's put that in context they enacted war no , murder on hundreds of thousands of iraqis despite the protests of it 's own citizens all while claiming to be the land of the free all while claiming that the american citizens know what 's best when will we stop fooling ourselves into thinking that america is n't and has not always been a terrorist state founded on seizing assets , landbases and resources by force , extortion and coercion ? america ( and it 's economic allies ) is the evil fucking empire from star wars and we should all be held accountable for it 's actions it 's no longer the good deeds you do that make you a good person , we need to start judging people by the good deeds that they do n't do , namely doing everything in their power and creativity to stop the destruction , rapine and psychopaths who are in charge of this monster truck holy fuck !
4	<> <> being an inside job seems more and more likely every day
1	it 's definitely not the worse i mean , the " war on terror " was certainly much more devastating than this however , since this happened in europe , and everyone gets upset rightfully so , might i add visa , though american , was doing business in european soil , with european companies there are laws that protect these companies , local and international laws the actions of the us effectively say this to europeans " we do n't give a fuck about your laws , our companies are going to act however we see fit we are above your laws " also , note that while the us was the one with the most info released , many other countries were affected , but none of them threw a hissy fit mostly because these countries had less to hide , and even less political power
1	yes except him " hey i'm thinking shooting some of these cocksuckers what do you think ? " " that would be fucking awesome i was thinking the same thing ! " " lets setup a nest in our car and do it ! " " i 'll get the tools , you get the gun " terrorism at it 's finest
5	not exactly , i am saying in europe a company can be forced to take on ( a ) as a customer if not doing so places ( a ) at a competitive disadvantage
4	i do n't think you can really ' chose ' to be a superpower though i totally get what you 're saying but after the cold war , it was n't like there were really any other options
4	you sir are spouting the words of a lifestyle anarchist , the worst kind of all ! it 's like saying , oh , you do n't like the us military ? do n't join it oh , you do n't like xe ? do n't invest in it you do n't like coca cola ? do n't drink it it 's never as simple as boycotting , and boycotting is so ineffectual in comparison the dominance that industry has over our lives to pretend that simply not buying a product hurts a company , when they make more money than you can imagine in tax breaks , collusory tactics etc is ignorant and incrementalist you call me apathetic and lacking effort , but forget that the tactic you are backing plays into the hands of the ruling class
1	because dycefreak ( http www reddit com user dycefreak ) is a coward and deleted his comment , this is what he said what you just said had nothing to do with anything that 's currently being discussed http www reddit com user dycefreak no one give 's a fuck about obama by the way this all happened before anyone even knew who he was this is my response you are spectacularly ignorant osama bin laden was put on the fbi 's most wanted list in <>

4	with a name like that i do n't know whether to downvote or upvote
1	the beltway sniper was a single pissed off redneck he was n't a terrorist , he was a serial killer and when you say " through striking fear " , i believe something different , i believe " an example of desperation " because i seek peace not justice because the fact of the matter is , " the ultimate goal was to get rid of american influence in the middle east " terrorist always stand for something and it 's not a simple ' fuck you ' they have a very good reason for wanting to end their lives in a violent explosion , and i care about what that reason is
6	it 's called being an accessory after the fact or in other cases , aiding and abetting united states code ( u s c ) , section two of title <> ( a ) whoever commits an offense against the united states or aids , abets , counsels , commands , induces or procures its commission , is punishable as a principal ( b ) whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the united states , is punishable as a principal one could make a strong argument that ( a ) applies here that by accepting this data and furthering the dissemination via their website , wikileaks aided manning under federal law , that is enough to mean that they could be tried for the exact same crimes as manning also , there are reports that several of the leaked cables resulted in some deaths do n't be surprised when a zealous prosecutor tosses in some felony murder rule charges as well that 's all assuming that manning acted independently and sent the info to wikileaks that would all change if there is enough evidence to point to an agency relationship as for it being unconstitutional , you are mistaken the pentagon papers cases stood for the proposition that you could not have a prior restraint on publication , but you most certainly can prosecute after the fact
6	i will be surprised if visa or mc claim " greater good " but dominant market position ? if there were more payments methods the governments concerned would just pressure them too
2	much ado about nothing what i got from your post was , wikileaks cool , eurpoe wikileaks stupid point to chose to make but whatever continue thinking you 're smart
4	i get your perspective a lot , and i guess it 's just in my overall negativity about the power of people against the face of dominant corporate interest it 's a daunting enemy however , i do think that you should check out http www youtube com watch ? v hpambpq8j7g it 's a good look at why charity , in fact , is not necessarily good especially the forced charity that comes with the capitalist csr process
1	shut the fuck up you spoiled brat
6	what american companies ? no american companies are involved here they 're suing visa europe and mastercard europe , not visa and mastercard separate , independent european companies
6	why would you spend money to buy music from a website that has no affiliation with the artists making the music ? they may be legal under russian law , but they certainly are n't paying the bands any meaningful royalties if the money you are spending does n't go to the people who made the music , why bother ? you can download a better version of the album off of bittorent for free
4	i often feel this way , however this is exactly what they would like you to believe why fight if you can never achieve any real change ? you have to fight even when you think it 's hopeless , change is possible but only if enough people believe it 's possible
3	you can then go and say that banks cannot refuse to provide financial services to terrorists and shit like that , what can you do when you ca n't stop them from getting money ? i personally think wikileaks and julian are doing something wrong , so this might give you some insight into my thinking here
2	what you are saying does n't make any sense i am talking specifically about corporations i am not saying that a boycott of a company is always the correct solution , and i am not saying that a boycott should be the only solution , as other means are valuable as well but you are saying that because the difference that a small action makes is n't huge , that the action is n't worth doing you are putting words into my mouth by trying to suggest that i condone anyone doing whatever they want and simply letting popularity profitability decide what is worthwhile i am simply making a specific point about taking individual action about what i believe to be right the logic you are pushing could be used in the same way to condemn all donations to charity that do n't completely solve every problem ever " oh , my donation does n't make much of a difference , so i just should n't bother " in fact , the entirety of your second paragraph seems to be just a jumble of vaguely anti corporate sentiments which you 're trying to connect to the idea of not bothering to take an action because said action is not " world changing " ultimately , the point you seem to be trying to make is one of degrees you suggest that a boycott is always a bad idea because it is n't enough okay so do more but you can still avoid buying a product or supporting a service based upon the actions of the company which offers it i do n't pretend that me refusing to use a credit card will take down the whole bank i do it because it 's my money , and i believe it should go to people who 'll be responsible in short i disagree with your accusation , but i can concede that there is always a need for more action i just do n't believe that the possibility of highly significant actions being necessary in order to affect change invalidates the impact and personal meaning or less significant actions like an individual boycott of an irresponsible or immoral company
4	to be fair , i do n't actually buy the product i do n't even have a sidewalk i was just looking for an example of something i do n't support have faith in , and roundup was the first thing listed on monsato 's wikipedia page i'm not trying to have a debate , stop picking at my semantics my overall point was that i 've always considered europe as having good ethics legally , so my faith in them continues if the lawsuit goes through , it wo n't do anything to restore my faith in humanity as a whole
3	he was a terrorist because he purposely tried to strike fear he struck at people that the media said he did n't target yet so no one would feel safe this is terrorism also , why the fuck did you delete your other comment , you coward ? the one about how no one knew who bin laden was before <> <> , despite engaging in other very well known terrorist attacks before then , and being placed on the fbi 's most wanted fugitives list in <> ?
1	'no one give 's a fuck about obama by the way this all happened before anyone even knew who he was ' me ' you are spectacularly ignorant osama bin laden was put on the fbi 's most wanted list in <> ' you yea , sorry about that , i misread osama for obama , not that you cared or noticed either mr ignorant caller lol its even in your quote of me , its hilarious watching you get all tight in the crotch over a mistake which now both you and i have made ha
6	what crime did wikileaks commit ? ( or " contributed towards " )
4	facilitaing a known enitity conducting espionage properly gotta be a law frowning on it there is , but that is n't something that wikileaks has been accused of , nor is it something they have been charged with indeed it does n't seem like they broke any us law at all
4	actually they were getting funded through charitable donations , dozens of which were shut down and their accounts frozen following <> <> but let 's leave that example off if you do n't like it and go abstract the same argument applies to bernie madoff or a money laundering ring does visa have the right to refuse to conduct transactions to an organization under investigation for major crimes during that investigation ?
4	well since i do n't know the competition rules of the eu , i ca n't say whether or not they 're breaking any laws or if it 's a matter of two sides interpreting it in different ways giant corporations like this have teams of lawyers on the payroll specifically to handle lawsuits such as this visa europe will have made enough money in the time it takes me to type this reply to more than adequately cover any legal fees they incur even if they lose the case , i very seriously doubt these companies are quaking in their boots over the money they stand to lose
1	taking a building or two down with an airplane is not how terrorism works terrorist always have a point to what they do , and very rarely that point is simply ' fuck you ' you really do n't know what you 're talking about there are many terrorist and plotted terrorist attacks that aimed simply at destroying lives , often through attacking symbolic places the ultimate goal was to get rid of american influence in the middle east , especially our support of israel , through striking fear this is also why they attacked the wtc in <> this is why rogues like the beltway snipers shot random people around dc to strike fear not because of a " fuck you " osama was already a target remember uss cole ?
4	regardless of how secret the info was , i feel like forcing an american company to support wikileaks is like forcing a homeowner to let a dog come in your house and take a pee on your walls not that everything wikileaks has done has been wrong and hurtful to america , but i do n't think its wrong to deny support
1	this was the creepiest , most disturbing thing the american government has done in the past <> years hahahahahahahahhahaha breath hahahhhaaahahahhah are you fucking kidding me ? financially choking a white collar whistleblowing organization ? that 's the worst ? it 's not the waterboarding ? not the inhumane and sickening torture of muslims in guantanamo ? it was n't our illegal invasion and our destruction over over a hundred thousands lives in the middle east ? it was n't the extraordinary assassination of bin ladin in another country without any trial or even proof of his death it 's shocking a month or two ago , the us government sent navy seals into a target half a mile from pakistan 's premiere military school , in a city full of military lifers and retirees , and assassinated someone without warning the pakistani government , or even letting them know do you feel safe ? safe knowing that the united states can enter a country and assassinate people with troops on the ground , and no one bats an eyelash ? and you 're telling me this is the most disturbing wake up
1	if you do n't give a ' fuck ' do n't post about not giving a ' fuck ' it ruins your argument
1	what the fuck ? ! that is fucked up
4	considering they offer many lossless formats , you ca n't really get " better " quality with torrents anyway , i purchase from them because my time is worth something to me downloading through their itunes like interface is very easy and intuitive , and all the tracks are named just how i want them , put in the exact directory structure i want , and include all the correct metadata without " ripp3d by h xer " in the comments field torrents have their place , especially for full discographies , but for one off tracks , allofmp3 is awesome
4	if we ever break out of it , it will only be because we used against them the one thing they ca n't bend at a whim fact of course , that requires a free trade of information , which at this point is the internet hence , everybody trying to restrict pass laws on the internet i could even see isp 's being in on this ( though i doubt it ) , with things like bandwidth caps and ridiculous prices
3	actually it would be illegal because it has been declared a terrorist organisation by us , uk , europe and un wikileak so far has n't so they are not an illegal entity unless us can prove that they are not covered under journalism laws they cant call them illegal and if they do then they might as well lock all free press in jail
4	although i disagree with your comparison i have upvoted you for making a good point being no legal expert , i do n't think wikileaks has broken any laws they are publishing information submitted to them it 's like comparing a shoplifter to a serial bomber sure , they are both criminals but there is a huge difference between them
3	good parallel , but al qaeda does n't get funded through donations or mc visa payments , i assure you edit and since you 're so hot for an argument al qaeda is a " terrorist " network influencing religious ideologies with direct violence for years upon years , wikileaks is not doing that despite what fox news tells you
4	not me downvoting you more likely it is people who ca n't be bothered refuting such specious logic if you had paid attention , i was n't commenting on the right or wrong of visa 's actions , but the legal status of wikileaks ' actions
4	from the article ( which , given your comments , you probably did n't read ) it was pointed out to these companies that their coordinated action on december <> last year to block all credit card transactions to wikileaks and datacell constituted a serious violation of the competition rules of the eu ( article <> ( <> ) and <> ) furthermore , that the actions of these companies have violated danish merchant laws when they terminated the payment services and by refused to reinstate them pressure or no pressure , it seems like they are indeed breaking two laws as for " paying for it " , i mean that they are facing legal action that is expensive in it self , and i imagine if they lose , they will have to pay much more i ca n't vouch for this , but someone in this thread has stated that visa has denied them over <> million dollars
4	i undownvoted you , because rational arguments should be debated ( even if just refuted ) , not downvoted the thing is , the state department have constantly been repeating that wikileaks is " breaking the law " but that 's a lie , or at best yet to be determined in fact , the new york times did exactly the same thing during the watergate scandal , and that was legal at the time ( if you might recall , in that standoff , ultimately nixon was forced to resign ) at the same time wikileaks keeps finding new information on how the us government has been breaking the law , and proving it so you can see why the state department has a good motive for trying to discredit wikileaks and get them shut down
3	these companies did act legally they were under government orders to cease doing any business with wikileaks not doing so would likely have put these companies in violation of the patriot act , would have led to various board members ceos being brought under investigation and being put on the no fly list for " sponsoring terrorism " , and god knows what other investigations into their day to day operations they are within their moral rights to take no action , whether or not they support a particular cause just because you do or do n't believe in something personally does not mean you 're obligated to actively support that cause , especially when doing so puts your personal freedoms , career , and company at risk personally i think that these company 's do have to be held to account , now , by anyone who can do that so that next time they do act ethically , morally and legally and what person , company , or governing entity has the power to overrule the us government ? the us government is the one making these demands that these companies do not do business with wikileaks there is nothing that you , i , or any company , government , or organization on this planet can say or do that can trump the actions the us government can take if they choose not to comply nothing under the best case scenario , these companies can choose not to comply the us government gets a court order forcing compliance under threat of prosecution , and we 're right back where we started from there , you just tack on charges under the patriot act , arrest , prosecution , government seizures of assets , jail time , etc etc etc there is no way for them to do what you want them to do without running head to head with the us government if you want to do that from the comfort an anonymity of the other side of your computer screen , you go right ahead and do that but there is no company in this country that wants to remain out of jail and in business that is willing to do so and i do n't blame them one bit it 's a no win battle
4	the problem is that they 're under similar pressure from the european union , who stands to be just as embarrassed by wikileaks as the us government now i do n't know how much power the eu holds , or if they have the capability to do the things the us government can do to american based companies like amazon and paypal but i'm sure that the eu is putting as much pressure as they can on visa europe as they possibly can people keep saying they are breaking the law they are not breaking the law refusing to do business with a person or company that could negatively impact their business ( even through no fault of their own ) is not unlawful continuing to do business , however , with a person or company that the us government ( or european union , respectively ) is telling you not to do business with is both unlawful and unethical as for " paying for it " i'm willing to bet that not doing business with wikileaks has not affected their bottom line one bit
3	as i 've said in another comment , in visa 's case , they are suing visa europe , a separate european entity , with no ties to the us with the exception that they are the sole licensees of visa 's service in europe they have absolutely no reason to fear the mighty patriot act so , do i understand them ? yes , of course , they are protecting their interests and playing nice with the us government , which is very powerful does that excuse them ? no , not a little they have a duty to follow the law ( and act ethically ) for breaking that , they are paying for it
4	<> <> on some mechanical and that 's after a very generous advance , and <> on licenses , and depending on if they were the writer a writer 's percentage on licenses look i do this for a living if people actually bought music it would be perfectly fine the fact that people say " i pirate because i am sticking it to the labels " is like saying i am going to stick it to the loggers by throwing away paper now i'm not saying the labels give artists the best deals ( but depending on who your management and rep is you can get a pretty lucrative one ) but sticking with the throwing away paper analogy the loggers ( labels ) hurt forests ( artists ) you throwing away paper ( piracy ) just makes them hurt trees ( artists ) more you do n't realize it but i see it everyday , and do n't tell me otherwise like i said i actually work in this business
1	who gives a fuck , people reading wikileaks are probably a majority of white , arm chair commando , from assorted european countries or from the us wanting to bitch about the us if your bitching about the manning kid , it 's his punishment for not doing a fucking job we all get paid to do a job right ? obviously it makes sense to not punish someone for breaking the rules and doing their job incorrectly , that they signed a contract to do i mean obviously wiki leaks is mega important because a whole bunch of white pasties out there want to watch videos of war and death and destruction and shit , because their x box did n't give them enough the worlds full of terrible shit , maybe it 's time for people start focusing on some good shit get over yourselves
4	it may end good , it may end bad , but it will be better than reality tv !
2	eu laws are shit as much i dislike mc and visa for doing this , it is their right to deny anyone business
6	what they dont tell you is that datacell said it would ddos mastercards servers and make this huge publicity stink if mastercard continued to not allow payments to wikileaks
1	good , make those motherfuckers pay through the nose for colluding with the government against the people
1	hey , if the title said " palestinian protests " , we 'd have hundreds of comments in the spirit of " fuck israel " why is nobody enraged about syria massacring its civilians ?
4	so , is there an actual recording of this ? it just seems like a strange thing for gadhafi to say
6	why would it be strange ? europe attacked him first
4	everything he says seems like a strange thing for him to say why stop now ?
4	that 's , like , really deep , man
4	you seemed to be confused about who decides what gods law is you seemed to imply that such a mythical figure exists to write " his " own laws , but i'm informing you that such a mythical figure does not exist , and everything you have ever heard about any " god " was made up by ordinary people , just like you and me
4	that 's a very naive view of religion religion absolutely invloves heads deciding and debating what the rules are they base them off holy texts and works of philosophy and theology , and " interpret " what is right and what gods word is no texts are perfect , they are all written by people , so the churches need to interpret and decide what to take note of , and what to disregard large parts of the bible have been written off as inaccurate or untrue by modern churches , whether it be because they are contradictory , or of questionable authenticity , or simply because the church thought they went against their traditional moral sense too much to be included as time goes on , the values of the church and society changes and when something they took notice of becomes increasingly seen as archaic or immoral , they can disregard it with any number of justifications thats not whats happening here though god is one thing , but organised religion is man made the church decided celibate gays ca n't be bishops , that rule is not written in the bible or anything like that , at least not the parts the church of england has taken notice of in a long time , so its their prerogative to change it
4	i never understood , and probably will never understand , how christians seem to think that they can just decide what god 's law is then go to r christianity and ask there are lots of educated enthusiastic christians there who could explain it to you i mean it 's not like they ask god if it 's okay when they " reform " their religion i'm pretty sure that 's completely inaccurate praying for guidance is pretty much exactly that
2	if i hated something and i had the chance to become head of that organisation , i would take the chance and drive the whole thing straight into the ground just sayin '
6	i'm pretty sure that 's completely inaccurate praying for guidance is pretty much exactly that what ? asking a question and waiting for an answer is n't the same thing as asking for something
4	i think it 's good , people are people , all are equal
6	what would jesus say ! ?
4	i never understood , and probably will never understand , how christians seem to think that they can just decide what god 's law is i mean it 's not like they ask god if it 's okay when they " reform " their religion
4	actually the real problem seems to be the alternative there is a split down the middle of the coe it is more likely it will split in half and the " conservative " half will rejoin the catholics
8	if someone can right off parts of a book while also claiming it to be the word of god how can i decide what is true ? sure an all knowing god would be able explain clearly and explain what to do in our ever changing world a part from that for me there is also the problem , that why would a god create rules if ( as an all knowing god ) he knows people are going to break them ? would n't he go on to explain further why i'm not allowed to commit these things ? or try to change the future ? why would he create me if he already knows in the future he is n't going to want me ? why send me to hell when you can just decide not to create me ? then , lets say , you really give us ' free will ' ( as some christians argue ) why create your book in the first place ? why create rules if you allow me to do anything ? why allow me to walk but no fly ? what type of superfiscal person creates something to worship themselves ? ( especially when they already know they are the greatest thing that exists ) then condemn them to an eternity without ' god ' if you do n't worship him ? why create that choice ? i'm sorry but there is too many questions why create rich poor powerful weak when you are the greatest ?
1	you know priests are fucking little boys when their sexual orientation is relevant even in a context of claimed sexual abstinence
6	what happened to the sexually repressed england we all used to know and love ?
6	it is a fact and i do know it this may surprise you , but there is no evidence at all for the existence of deities like no evidence , not even a single bit of evidence , none at all
4	i think it 's quite divisive i think they could possibly loose members on balance , with quite a few people particularly from the high church of england going back into the catholic fold the higher ends of the church of england are very close to the catholic church in much of it 's style and ceremony except no pope and priests are allowed to be married whereas the lower end is much more like protestantism in a truer lutherian sense more akin to the protestantism seen on the european continent , but also in scotland and northern ireland the pope has already been " courting " sections of the church of england that are opposed to gay clergy , offering to bring them in , but allowed to retain much of their anglican tradition
4	disgusting no wonder the anglican membership is dropping like a rock
4	i'm an atheist just like you but it 's simply untrue to call it a fact you do n't know , so do n't pretend , that 's what the theists do
6	damn right man , agree with every word anyone who is delusional enough to ignore the history facts deserves to be made a fool of i used to be muslim and islam is pretty explicit on the subject , homosexuality wrong what kind of a masochist would have to be to want so desperately to subscribe that sort of institution ?
1	buy an ad or fuck off , fucking spammer
4	maybe the children were living with their parents even better , just like the old libertarian confederacy your parents were slaves and so will you be a slave it 's a shame the federal government of india interrupted such freedom
4	forced bonded labor ? sounds like a libertarian paradise to me
4	exactly the entire clip was about how good the government was too
4	i would n't discount this completely israel , only a couple of days ago was insisting they wanted armed agents in all european airports i do n't particularly like israel , but you ca n't spit anywhere in the world without the mossad knowing about it whether it 's gaddafi or some other threat , my bet is that something is brewing in europe
4	it almost seems like his top advisers are cia agents how convenient that after the us starts to show signs of disinterest in continuing this campaign , he threatens to take the war outside of libya 's borders he has had a long time to make threats like this , why now ?
4	sounds like a great set up for a false flag attack
4	yeah , this was a good idea
6	just a thought what if he has allies that we do n't know of yet ?
4	more like our planes wo n't even make it across scotland
3	maybe that were only rummors , but it has been said he supplied explosives to terrorists ( ira ) and he also bombed a plane nato is probably too afraid to let him survive that conflict and they are anxious for an excuse ( like an act of war ) to roll in the tanks
1	" fuck it ! we 're taking greenland ! "
3	gaddafi really is a terrorist ( http en wikipedia org wiki pan am flight <> ) and a brutally oppressive dictator the " powers that be " do n't need to set him up as anything what made bin laden an effective boogeyman is that nobody knew where he was or what he was up to gaddafi is nothing like that
6	what kind of crack are you smoking ?
4	happy birthday !
6	what do you call a person who 's a member of the armed forces ? i call them a soldier i , as well as many other people , refer to multiple soldiers as " troops " what do you call it when a soldier has his feet on terra firma ? i call that a troop on the ground what do you call it when you have multiple troops with their feet on solid ground within the borders libya ? troops on the ground in libya does n't matter if war were declared or not technicalities only count in sports and politics everything else needs to depend on that pesky thing called " the real world "
4	it was not immediately clear whether gaddafi could make good on such threats haha
1	he will strike at us like bees ! ! ! holy fuck , i hate bees !
8	hey , you 're the one who thinks the cold war should have heated up over a completely legal loophole and you ca n't seem to get the difference between a military adviser and active combatant in terms of the rules of war hippy reddit folk who run around and ca n't comprehend the rules of war should only speak when spoken to to put it in really simple terms , military advisers are not recognized as active combatants in war and their legality in terms of combat is that of an adviser as long as they do n't take up arms against the enemy they might as well be considered accountants and taxidermists i pity the soul that has to explain to you what the rules of engagement are for soldiers that are part of a nation 's army and people for private military companies
4	you did not , my bad i see one big problem with " push the tanks in and it would be over in a week " i assume u meant , right from the start if not , ignore what im about to write if the nato pushed for an armed intervention ( with troops , tanks and so on ) do you think the majority of the arabian ( muslim ) people would think of it as " help " ? there is a real risk that the extremists would use it as just another reason to rally the people against the western countrys , getting more and more to join their ranks dont get me wrong , i 'd like to see the nato to help lybia , but ( and thats a big but ) i would want them to help syria , bahrain , somalia too and the list goes on and on
5	yeah butthurt much and dont forget saddam had nukes too
5	i was just comparing the " jews america zionism did <> <> and ovaltine flu shots is way for america " comment with even more silly story of saddam having nuclear weapons gadaffi ? did i say anything about gadaffi having nukes ? your just being a nigger your shitt comments are not worth being on dramtic fanatic whtaever
4	gadaffi has never had nukes , nor has he ever had nukes , in fact he allowed in inspectors to destroy his wmd 's and there were no nukes reported ( http www armscontrol org act <> <> libya ) but thank you for donating material to encyclopedia dramatica and making redditors look sillier in general remember , never let fact , spamming silliness and butthurt ever get in the way of making you look like a twat
4	if the nato pushed for an armed intervention ( with troops , tanks and so on ) do you think the majority of the arabian ( muslim ) people would think of it as " help " ? it matters what libyans would think , not what other arabs would and judging by what i 've seen on al jazeera they were pretty happy the planes saved them in benghazi occupation like that in iraq would n't please them , but a contingent of tanks could probably push the stalemate and end very costly air operations they need to do another <> iraq , rebel infantry can do the rest there is a real risk that the extremists would use it as just another reason to rally the people against the western countrys , getting more and more to join their ranks you 're completely right , a big worry is that they would create another iraq or afghanistan another is probably deaths of nato soldiers which carry bigger political implications than deaths of other people , also demonstrated in iraq and afghanistan foreign occupation gives legitimacy to local opportunist resistance leaders that otherwise would n't get podium to rally their countrymen limited intervention would probably be welcomed by libyans and would not lead to civil war as their culture is different than that of afghanistan or iraq because they are , like tunisians , less religious or radicalized , however like you said you can never be sure that someone would not grab an opportunity to radicalize the population under foreign occupation i would want them to help syria , bahrain , somalia too and the list goes on and on right
3	i read that gaddafi has fallen out of favor of some terrorist groups because he tried cracking down on them within the last decade to strengthen relations with the west
4	exactly its not like he has n't done it before
4	beats me , it 's not like he 's becoming increasingly desperate or anything
3	aside from a terrorist campaign he does n't have the means to make nato pay for anything
3	you guys are being naive here gaddafi can sponsor terrorist groups
3	i did n't get the impressions it was a direct threat more of a " your actions will create future terrorists who will seek revenge " he said something about attacks on offices etc would be justified because they 've suffered similar attacks
1	i'm sorry , but you 're a fucking idiot
4	well like i said earlier , if we are going to use your standards of having troops on the ground ( non direct participants who advise in combat ) then we would all be nuclear dust from the soviets retaliating against us in the <> 's or the united states retaliating in the <> 's and <> 's when the soviets advised the koreans and vietnamese luckily since the rest of the world does n't go by your standards , having advisors is not internationally known as having " troops on the ground " they become troops on the ground when the advisors actively and consistently participate in combat in this case the political technicality becomes a part of the real world
4	oh thissssss type of thread jews america zionism did <> <> and ovaltine flu shots is way for america to control minds , alluh ackbar ! edit to be fair and to give this thread one last wink a a nod of seriousness before i consider this thread encyclopedia dramatica fodder ( http encyclopediadramatica ch reddit arab apologists ) i highly doubt that the u s special forces are based in mali ( http www bbc co uk news world <> ) other edit i know it sounds like i'm being mean man but i seriously ca n't get your english , the wording sounds like it was done by the people who spam out ukranian porn
4	this may be highly inappropriate comparison , but did anyone else think of the " broken " a i in games like civiii where the utterly outmatched and out gunned nation makes bold demands and threatens to strike full force in a most unrealistic way ? turns out reality is unrealistic
4	" gaddafi spoke from an unknown location in a likely sign of concern over his safety " yea thats pretty likely
4	sounds like qaddafi 's been watching oprah ( http i imgur com l4shc gif )
3	i really doubt he has a lot to spare when he is fighting a civil war anything is possible , but how likely is it ? sounds like unnecessary fear to me
5	knowing assad fires him at what ?
5	sana 's report gave no reason for the firing of gov ahmed abdul aziz another beirut based activist , omar idibi , said the hama governor was respected by residents for trying to avoid further bloodshed not to worry i'm sure sana will announce that they suddenly discovered that mr abdel aziz is a secret mossad cia al qaeda operative after a few days , maybe he might even have an ' unfortunate accident ' or perhaps he 'll suddenly commit suicide by shooting himself in the head six times or more people who fall out of favour with the syrian regime tend to have a short life expectancy and often die under mysterious circumstances in other news , clinton and medvedev will applaud the move and call it " real reform "
4	for those of you who missed it yesterday , this is how the protests look like http www youtube com watch ? v nlgf3czbqbu https www youtube com watch ? v bpv69v2gyvw & feature player detailpage the number of protests have significantly increased
6	" to drop the case against all <> anti tax avoidance campaigners " what the hell is " anti tax avoidance ' ? it 's either tax avoidance or tax support
4	so <> people went into a store , caused a ruckus , and would not leave i do n't really care if they get prosecuted or not i do n't hold any particular love for fortnam and mason ( though their tea is good ) , but it seems like they did something illegal if i went into any other store and started yelling , and refused to leave , then i would be arrested it does n't really matter what i was yelling , maybe the store was doing something wholly illegal it does n't matter , it 's still not legal to go into a store and yell you ca n't protest against a private company on their own property you can only choose not to go there or buy their products
1	the fact that people are n't flipping the fuck out at this amazes me
4	wow i guess the internet is dead bravo , prince
3	dude , you still wo n't get shot for looking at a soldier the wrong way if you live in cuba , while in afghanistan they 'll kill you and say you 're a taliban terrorist
3	gaza is in bad shape but places under nazi germany were in far worse shape than any place on the list ( excluding perhaps north korea ) therefore , the fact gaza is not on the list is indication that at the very least , gaza is nowhere near the horrors being maliciously ascribed to it by the anti israeli crowd
4	a siege makes them israeli slaves ? nice to know words mean nothing except what the anti israelis want them to mean at a given moment gaza gets about <> tons in <> truckloads of daily shipments the palestinian leadership in gaza fails to order enough to fill the entirety of the truckloads , so they come not completely full israel is n't even the bottleneck on the entry of goods to gaza gaza 's residents can actually travel in and out through egypt basically every single point in your comment is false
4	probably iceland , australia , new zealand , canada , & c places where implied or constitutional rights are unlikely to be impinged
4	i read " the last free places " i started reading , scrolling around , and i was like , wtf ?
4	i live in china and i have to say it 's not even half as bad as its made out to be i have a very normal life and can use facebook , skype , reddit , any foreign press website , as do chinese people its not very fair to compare china to the likes of turkmenistan and north korea also this list seems badly put together , iran , iraq , afghanistan and a host of small sub saharan countries ruled by violent military dictatorships are missed out , probably too small , insignificant and underroported for this magazine to care ' freedom ' is a concept made by americans to look down their noses at the rest of the world people from no other country place a high value on this vague word america is not even really free in many ways they do n't have a very ' free ' political system where parties represent each part of the political spectrum rant over
4	the difference between what really happens to what people think happens it 's a great point a lot of " human rights " activists are focusing on gaza , though they can do a lot more good other places it 's not a human right issue , it 's a political issue
4	in that respect reddit is just like the unhrc reality vs making america look bad
4	fun fact majority of this places are active members of un human right counsel
8	damn , the usa is also the least happy according to one poll ( http www huffingtonpost com <> <> <> north korea global happiness index china happiest place n <> html ) sorry to hear americans , hope your country does better in the future !
4	ok lets take cuba literacy http en wikipedia org wiki list of countries by literacy rate cuba <> , us <> infant mortality http en wikipedia org wiki list of countries by infant mortality rate cuba <> , us <> life expectancy http en wikipedia org wiki list of countries by life expectancy cuba and us joint <> environmental performance index http epi yale edu countries cuba <> , us <> happy planet index http en wikipedia org wiki happy planet index cuba <> , us <> gdp http en wikipedia org wiki list of countries by gdp <> <> us <> , cuba <> not everything is great in cuba but living in a country with enormous natural resources per capita you have no right to be so condescending to a country that has managed so much against the backdrop of us funded death squads , assassination and cia coups in all of it 's neighbours
4	this looks like a list of evil commie nations and dirty arabs in other words not biased at all
2	i dislike these kind of assessments ? what is ' freedom ' in any case ? going by certain established critera disregards that certain people might have their own ideas of what constitutes freedom , or liberty
4	it 's like a " who 's who " of the next to revolt !
4	i do n't see how national media glorifying their own struggle against a foreign invader is any proof of censorship , or how it is funny have you ever been to china ? i think you took my post the wrong way i was not implying that their struggle against the japanese is funny , that would be ridiculous but saying there is no proof of censorship is just plain ignorant they pick and choose what parts of their history they want to share with the public , way more so than in the united states sure , obviously american movies are often biased in favour of america , but if you go to china you 'll realize that comparing this sort of thing to u <> or pearl harbour is laughable it 's a whole different level of misinformation
4	china also have quite a bit of freedom and an efficient central government , but some really shitty municipal level leadership but that will change slowly therez talk of media reform and judiciary independence from top officials like wen jia bao china is not that oppressive i ca n't prove that really just take a vacation to anywhere in china i guaranteed you will have a good time , even tibet
7	ok i'm confused , are you arguing that censorship in the us and the uk is at the same level as china ? there 's no way you can believe that and " empire of the sun " and " shanghai " both touch on the chinese role in ww2
2	there is nothing quite like reddit to call bullshit on bullshit
4	having the largest prison population in the world is only one good reason for them to be on the list
1	fucking tell me about it i usually stay up late at night wishing i could finally get my finances together to move to somalia with my family one day one day
4	yeah , you can use sites like facebook , twitter , and youtube only if you have a proxy or vpn i was just there , and those three and many other sites are blocked everyone i spoke to who did have access to those sites used a vpn they paid for i enjoyed my time though , and people seem happy and pretty free for the most part , minus the part where they ca n't vote or protest anything
4	just outta curiosity where in china do you live ? from what i 've understood from articles and some of my chinese friends is that some places , like hong kong ( i'm including hk and macau as part of china ) , do n't experience the same oppression as most parts of china perhaps you can comment on the accuracy of this statement ?
2	i just spent a month in china and facebook and youtube were banned in mainland china unless you 're in hong kong , i have to call bullshit on this edit also , there is a lot of censoring and straight up lies about of their history at museums and such television is also mostly ( if not all ) state run and heavily censored one thing i thought was particularly funny was there is a war history channel which plays , almost exclusively , chinese movies about them beating the japanese in ww2 without giving credit to the allies
6	why is the most free states are the ones i least wanna go to ?
4	oh wow context fail on my part i looked at your comment in isolation
4	you must really like your downvotes
4	you do realize hamas controls gaza , executes all of the gays that it would like , and israel exerts no control over any of it ? i am sure many of the thousands of people israel has killed were also gay just as i am sure you realize israel is running a blockade on gaza you are ridiculous as i already explained they do get what they like we all know that 's not true they do n't get what they like they get what you allow them to get that 's what a blockade is all about they are not filling the shipments that they 're already getting it 's not your place to restrict anything to anybody funny that you try to make it about religion or culture , which are completely irrelevant it 's completely relevant to a person raised in the jewish religion and culture an occupation is a moral and just thing a blockade on millions of people is a moral and just thing to rational atheists it 's not then why are gaza 's authorities not ordering enough to fill up the shipments ? ordering from who ? israel ? because they probably have given up on israel to deliver what they want and need they are probably looking at other means of getting what they need given that hamas uses all of its power to commit war crimes and attack israeli cities with rockets it makes sense for israel to attempt to restrict the rocket attacks with a siege given that the idf routinely launches attacks on gaza killing and injuring many people it makes perfect sense that hamas should attack israel any way they can what does n't make sense is that even as the siege was pretty much removed , intellectually dishonest ( the main bulk of anti israelis ) continue to complain if it was " pretty much removed " you would not be blocking these ships israel is doing some really bad things , which you barely hear about ( mainly west bank settlement related ) , but all you hear about are false allegations about bad things that israel does n't do israel does many bad things thanks to the support of the vast majority of israelis and the vast majority of the jewish diaspora including you as long as jews world wide act as apologists and deniers israel will continue to do bad things so pay yourself on the back and congratulate yourself for helping israel do many bad things
5	we 've been blowing up a huge chunk of the middle east for almost a decade now how are you not ashamed of what our government is doing in our name ? it 's even more sad than that , we 're a complete war country if you look through our history , we have always had a ridiculous number of major wars going on as george carlin put it this country has only been around for <> years , and we 've already had <> major wars we average a major war every <> years in this country what 's going on now is hardly new
6	why yes , <> of their funds come directly from the us government
4	i loves me a good logical fallacy !
4	funny how many countries " close " to the us are in this list and cuba is on there while bahrain , iran and saudi arabia are not hillary ious iraq , afghanistan , haiti , south sudan and kazakhstan are also soooo extremly free
5	the link reminded me of this lisa it 's from my pen pal anya ! reads anya voice over dear lisa , as i write this , i am very sad our president has been overthrown and voice changes to that of a man replaced by the benevolent general krull all hail krull and his glorious new regime ! sincerely , little girl
6	gaza ? what does it mean to be more or less free ? political freedoms , living conditions ? how are such rankings even produced ?
1	as a canadian , i'm regularly disgusted by my fellow canadians that go to resorts in cuba for vacation way to support a horrible dictatorship with a long history of human rights issues even everybody 's darling , david suzuki , praised cuba what the fuck
4	everywhere but here everything is just fine here worry about elsewhere , we got everything under control here just sit and be a good little citizen now
1	why do n't the cia just kill all these murderous despots ? seriously , it ca n't be that hard i 'd take a bullet for executing one of these sick fucks oh , and i wish my country would stop selling arms to saudi arabia
2	bullshit ! ! ! !
4	it 's a good question , indeed perhaps they do n't perceive their election as fraudulent as others
4	i have seen inaccurate movies about us exploits in wwii check out u <> and pearl harbour on the otherhand , i have seen chinese wwii movies where the protagonist is a downed flying tigers pilot the chinese were fighting the japanese since <> , half a decade before any official american involvement i do n't see how national media glorifying their own struggle against a foreign invader is any proof of censorship , or how it is funny american media equally plays down wwii involvement of the chinese and the soviets , the two countries with the most losses during the war , even though china was responsible for tying down most of japan 's troops and the soviets were responsible for taking berlin
6	why is my country , vietnam not on there ? i say something bad about the government openly and the first thing people do is tell me to shut up and that am risking a lot
4	it looks like they were mostly going on internal repression , what a government does to its own people gaza and the west bank are repressed externally more than internally
6	why would they mention the us ? we have quite a bit of freedom we have some shitty leadership right now , but that changes every couple of years to mention the us when there are many other nations which are repressive and oppressive would do this list a disservice
1	i have to admit that it 's infuriating how little people understand about how fucking shitty the cuban government has been to us over the last <> years yeah , it 's not as backwards afghanistan but it 's totalitarian
1	a siege makes them israeli slaves ? that 's the purpose of it yes gaza gets about <> tons in <> truckloads of daily shipments they should get as much as they want , need and can afford not what you think they should get the fact that you think you should be able dictate what they should get , when they should get it and how much they should get is a prime indicator of how immoral and disgusting your religion and culture are israel is n't even the bottleneck on the entry of goods to gaza yes it is gaza 's residents can actually travel in and out through egypt this is a recent development and one that made israel very angry let 's see how long israel lets this continue
4	one should bear in mind the political baggage that comes from " freedom house " which gets <> of its funding from the us government that is not to say that these countries are ' free ' in any sense , but a list like this will certainly lend itself to biases based on which countries are omitted and which ones are n't just as a small example they list south ossetia as being ' unfree ' but give no reasons i certainly wonder what it would be like if the georgian military took control after shelling the population with rockets i'm sure they would have turned it into a bastion of freedom and democracy
4	somalia is on here , and china but not singapore ? kewl , guess we got us a good ol fashioned " people we do n't like " list
4	how is china and even tibet on the list ? i prefer them over countries like afghanistan , iran or iraq
2	this is a bullshit list libya at number <> give me a break you wont see pakistan , afghanistan , iraq or the palestinian states , because that would go against american foreign policy ever wonder why we are in libya and have not interfered in any other revolution oil and less know monetary policy gaddafi was going to introduce currency tied to a gold standard
4	i 've heard that education there only costs like a dollar a day , for less than a cup of coffee your children can be educated and clothed ! now that 's a free and happy place to live i bet !
4	i came here expecting to see angsty reddit children making polemic cases for how the us should be on the list amongst the likes of north korea and somalia i was not disappointed
1	then what about yemen , bahrain , oman , etc and you 're telling me that saudi arabia is less repressive than some of those countries in the list above it ? fuck you
4	free ! good to live in an anarchy is perfectly free , but not very safe
4	not saying that the iraqi and afghan governments are not repressing people to a certain extent ( i am admittedly uninformed on that particular topic ) , but i think when some people compare china and cuba with iraq and afghanistan they 're confusing security with freedom the government can repress the shit out of you without you being at high risk of bombings , kidnapping and the like too many people fail to make this distinction free countries must always sacrifice some security for that freedom i like to say that i prefer freedom over security , and to the extent that those scales lean in freedom 's direction where i live , i do but i bet there are people in fairly free ( but highly insecure ) countries who would give their left nut to spend some time in cuba or china edit i should type faster this thread saw a lot of posts while i was typing mine , and it seems i'm not the only one who sees this distinction not that i thought i was the only one , but i wanted to say it first , dammit
4	i would actually prefer china over a lot of countries seriously , major cities in china are really among world class developed nations ' you actually get more freedom if you are a foreigner even more freedom if you are a influential one most corp have their own vpn besides its not like secret police is gonna knock on your door the moment u post something politically unapproved by the gov therez <> billion ? netizen and couple thousand internet police and the auto censor is only good at deleting stuff they really do n't have the time to come physically delete you you really have a greater chance of getting assassinated by the cia
4	i bet you are an american and never been there just take the route from canada here and visit there its not that bad for a tourism destination and you get to walk around anywhere you like man their cigars are dirt cheap and better than any stuff you find state side they have to stage the whole country to fake this its really different from that fake tour to nk the resort and hotels are owned by the gov tho but i would n't take a vacation to afghan
1	that 's the purpose of it yes you do realize hamas controls gaza , executes all of the gays that it would like , and israel exerts no control over any of it ? they should get as much as they want , need and can afford not what you think they should get the fact that you think you should be able dictate what they should get , when they should get it and how much they should get is a prime indicator of how immoral and disgusting your religion and culture are you are ridiculous as i already explained they do get what they like they are not filling the shipments that they 're already getting funny that you try to make it about religion or culture , which are completely irrelevant yes it is then why are gaza 's authorities not ordering enough to fill up the shipments ? this is a recent development and one that made israel very angry let 's see how long israel lets this continue given that hamas uses all of its power to commit war crimes and attack israeli cities with rockets it makes sense for israel to attempt to restrict the rocket attacks with a siege what does n't make sense is that even as the siege was pretty much removed , intellectually dishonest ( the main bulk of anti israelis ) continue to complain israel is doing some really bad things , which you barely hear about ( mainly west bank settlement related ) , but all you hear about are false allegations about bad things that israel does n't do an israeli arab ( http www reddit com user thedevilsdictionary ) summed it up well how about , go after the myriad of problems they openly exhibit , and stop making bullshit up ? just a thought it 's not just reddit here , it 's the pro palestinian people in general so eager to jump on any scrap of dirt , when there 's a mountain of it <> feet away
4	ha lol i thought the article was titled " the last fred places on earth in <> " i was totally confused i was like " whoosh ! " it 's the l ea st free places on earth okay i get it now derr
6	" freedom house ranking " yeah americans are not on the list ? thats because the report is american dumbassese and i never saw libya in reports like these before obvious war propaganda im surprised they even dared to mention saudi and china
4	" north koreans enjoy the lowest levels of freedom in the world according to freedom house 's rankings " that is not really funny
1	interestingly i do n't see fiji in the list , nor do i see few other middle eastern nations , along with pakistan in pakistan , even internet does n't have freedom i do n't see israel and palestine and iraq and afghanistan this list is bull i suppose adding iraq and afghanistan and israel makes america look bad , huh ? amongst the most free nations , i would like to vote india man , those indians they can do whatever the fuck they want over there , and there is peace
4	it is odd that your country is not up their , but compared to your neighbors ( china , laos ) the state repression of free speech is not as great , or just has n't been coordinated enough to reach the ears of foreign journalists for example , while china has gone a great length into censuring western media like cnn , bbc , and youtube , your government does n't really care this , and other gestures from the vietnamese government , should go a long way in making sure that vietnam is a sure choice for foreign investment as china tries to reign in and keep its tight control
4	you 're wrong just like the parent if you took the time to read the actual document , you can see that the gaza strip and the west bank are both " not free "
4	wow , you 're dreaming big i 'd settle for syria
4	people from all the country on the list can post on reddit if they have an interenet connection it is not like this is hukcheamingsucksdicks com
4	the coalition government is a good deal better than people think still pretty shitty as a place to live , and terrifying , and dangerous , but as far as freedom goes , it rightly ranks above the countries on this list tsvangiri 's been a moderating influence on the government 's own corruption , the rampant criminal activity ( even the activity influenced by zanu pf 's policies ) does n't restrict freedom so much as terrify the hell out of everyone in the country i mean , really , they held free elections , and the dictator for life was voted out he did n't step down anyway , but people were free enough to vote against him , and he did form a coalition government
6	compromises of freedoms in first world countries are small potatoes compared to what 's going on in a majority of the world even in the higher end of the developing world , we 'd be surprised at some of the shit that goes on , oppression that 's facilitated both by corruption and the government i remember talking to recent migrants i used to work about what goes on in their countries and i was stunned it made my bitching about the government seem like a spoiled child having a tantrum i can see why they would do anything to get to the first world however , this does n't mean that we should simply accept what we have and stop whining i still want equal rights for everyone no matter their gender , race , financial situation or sexuality i still want people to be able to express themselves artistically or politically without censorship if anything , seeing the situation in these countries reminds me that in the first world , there is more of a chance than anywhere of creating a truly ' free ' society it also reminds me that many of these regimes are directly or indirectly created by the first world in the first world , we have more of an influence over our government than anywhere else and we should use that influence to try to steer our governments away from foreign policy that breeds these regimes

4	exactly they were n't designed to withstand exactly what was very likely to hit them cutting corners to save money not so bad with a wind turbine , deadly with a nuke

8	sorry to be crass , but somebody has to do it i do n't think it 's realistic to expect other countries to send their workers in , because no one in their right mind would want to go near there i'm not saying this is right , but at this stage anybody will do i 've been in the army they say " we need some volunteers you , you and you ! " chernobyl was fixed in the same way and maybe this is what is required here
6	what happened to the retired engineers who were offering to go in ?
6	what do rights groups know about anything ?
4	well those who are poor are more likely to work in such dangerous conditions than someone who could work for more money in a safer environment i dont see a problem
4	yah , and they 're being excellent pay in a country with excellent medical care this a good option for these people
4	people who should be doing that work before a vulnerable minority group does tepco management tepco board members japan 's nuclear regulators japan 's elected officials once you run out of those people , tepco shareholders the real owners of the company are much more appropriately next in line to face consequences for what their company did they took the dividends and capital gains in the good years now gypsies die to clean up the mess ?
1	here , for this case , there is no need for anonymity , nothing is at stake for the informant the source has said " the maid got the job at the midtown hotel because her union saw her as an earner " so basically he accuses his bosses ( and the whole fucking industry , basically ) of running a prostitution ring and you 're saying nothing is at stake are you fucking crazy ? ? secondly , even if she worked as a prostitute , that is no reason to disregard the rape charges yes it is , especially if it 's a " he said she said " situation and she discussed how she 's gonna cash in on it because " he 's rich and i know what i'm doing "
1	my point was that the source is unidentified while the refutation is on the record and my point is that you have no point their statement means absolutely nothing ( unless you 're so fucking naive that you expect corrupt criminal organizations to fucking indict themselves ) for all we know , this reporter made the source up well , everything they 're saying makes perfect sense and fits into the bigger picture but others will be looking into it and i'm sure there will be a publication with enough credibility for you
1	it 's from a single source man , i'm sure you could find more than one knowledgeable guy from that hotel who would be willing to talk the management would just hand you over the list of employees and you would make those people expose their bosses and risk their careers for fucking nothing because you are so fucking awesome please report back to us tomorrow about your progress ! which provided no corroborating evidence like pictures of other powerful world leaders getting blowjobs from her ? or signed , official pimping contracts ? that would help ? man , i guess i 'll just email the un and they 'll start collecting corroborating evidence for you ! i'm kind of getting tired of the stupidity of r worldnews
4	this and the taped phone conversation with her pimp where she discussed the possibility of cashing in on the situation settles it for me she also returned to clean this and another room before reporting the " crime " to her supervisor , and then lied about this and i'm glad i do n't have to reevaluate my judgement of people , because this guy ( http www youtube com watch ? v qviodu4nqza ) 's not a rapist
1	stop calling the people at the ny post " journalism " it 's a fucking tabloid
1	she does n't even belong to the union that 's supposedly her pimp that 's irrelevant the accusation is that somebody had selected her as an " earner " who 's contradicted by an on the record union official why , what the fuck did you expect ? ? ? " yes , sir , we 're hiring and promoting personell that 's willing to suck cock that 's what we do that 's how the system works "
4	it 's a deal the government parties had to agree to in a trade of votes for pushing back retirement age to aid the economy , pushed by a far right party of course now , the government has to pretend to actually like the idea other things they had to agree on reducing the width of the unplowed land belt between fields and streams and free wifi at universities ( which of course was already there , but the politician who wanted it did n't realize ) tl dr politicians suck
6	i think the most troubling aspect of this is that the basketcase socialist tendencies of the greek people are not being represented that 's more important than whether or not they resurrect the drachma or want to pay their taxes the only issue really being debated is whether greece will fail now , or later what 's really happening is that current investors in greece , domestic or foreign , are demanding that their current risk be displaced onto the various publics around the world , or other investors essentially , it is another transfer of risk from a set of private groups to the usual punching bags these reforms , though clearly logical , will not hold owing to the greek peoples being fully justified in crucifying their " representatives " they will be back in the same mess in another election cycle , or sooner the best thing that could happen for greece is that they get completely roiled and have a constitutional crisis , and subsequently eject the " reinforced " proportional representation system with its " constituency voting " ( http en wikipedia org wiki elections in greece ) transferring the mandate of the voters in each constituency directly to the candidates instead of the party bosses would not allow for this past weekend 's snub any system in which legislators can be ejected for not voting right is flawed
4	luckily for germans paying taxes is actually the norm rather than a strange exception and they do n't retire at <> so it seems like they should get to enjoy social benefits , and other goodies in return ? am i crazy ?
4	that was a very smart move for the king he offered a false dicotomy you want everything to stay as it is or do you want the king to have less powers ? nowhere in the ballot was the choice to remove the king completely so if you wanted that option you could vote " no " for the reforms , which puts you on the same boat as monarchists or you could protect on the streets which other people luke accuse you of being against democracy , since you did n't bothered to vote the king got what he wanted and even if he never gets back the power he lost he set morocco to a slow path to an english like democracy , but probably after the next generation even so the king keeps his social status and money , and does n't need to go throught the trouble of actual king caring for anyone smart move , any king that is n't a sociopath should follow him
4	this is just a joke , a trick from the king to show the international community he is for the change , so it 'll give him a good excuse to crush any voice of dissent no one i know voted for this shit and it still got <> , what a crock of shit
6	what does cyber warfare have to do with a game about shooting stuff ?
4	yeah , the united states has something like that too it 's called america 's army <> or at least that 's what this chinese game sounds a lot like
4	however it would explain very well part of the <> , <> found on her account and her telephone bills there are lots of other ways to explain the <> the evidence so far is that it is drug money laundered by others into her account she seems to be uneducated and naive and , to put it succinctly , an amoral bottom dwelling survivor it does ' t make much sense for a maid to continue working as a maid if she had actual access to the money , rather than simply had an account opened in her name well specific is n't the word as during the interview , she is extremely vague about the circumstances of the alleged assault attempt does n't sound that vague banon " for my first book i had to interview people about their biggest mistake he did n't really answer but suggested we meet again he asked me to come to his hotel he asked me to hold his hand while recording the interview , and then he kept on trying to touch other parts of my body i was wearing a black turtle neck we fought on the floor he sent me an sms after saying do i scare you ? " it ended really badly we ended up fighting it finished really violently " " we fought on the floor it was n't a case of a couple of slaps i kicked him , he unhooked my bra , he tried to open my jeans " he acted like a " horny monkey " " i said the word ' rape ' to scare him but it did n't seem to scare him much , which suggests he was used to it " okay , so let 's wait for the trial before talking of " evidence " , then why should n't we talk about it ? we can mention the source , and the fact that it is n't confirmed by the prosecution ( who have some obligations to stay out of the media to avoid tainting the trial )
4	well , all this shows is that many people were happy when the news broke out , and were enthusiastically spreading it no surprise here and even the prosecution must have seen this as an easy opportunity for a career boost still , no right wing conspiracy way too amateurish the lady was just way too stupid ( she was cleaning two other rooms after the alleged rape , for peter 's sake ! )
4	no , my point was that just because she has a history of lying does not mean she was not raped just because dsk has been accused of rape in the past does not mean he 's raped anyone here her case is falling apart , and you 're still beating the drum for his head quit being so emotionally invested in his guilt and admit there are no lines between which you can magically read and determine what he 's likely to have done or not innocent until proven guilty you communist
4	sure , this is a valid approach if you have a data set as input to build your chain , and another data set to validate your approach where will you get such a ( known good ) data set ? as i said previously ( although not very prominently ) , there is no way to verify the validity and as long as humans will lie to avoid punishment , there will never be a way a good approach would be proper characterisation , i e full psychological profiling with an accuracy etc that is beyond today 's techniques and understanding let me clarify my beliefs here that there is nothing wrong with bayesian methods , but there is a problem with implementing it in this case i agree that there are many problems with how law is applied , what the courts consider to be logic etc we should strive to make the system better , and i do n't see how statistics can work in this case
4	eyewitness testimony is hideously unreliable yes , this is well known and has been for centuries , not just since someone compiled statistics and drew a graph as for physical evidence , this too can be faked absolutely sometimes the forgeries can be exposed sometimes innocent people are convicted on forgeries and sometimes , the defence can use the spectre of a forgery and a wrongful conviction to create reasonable doubt or the prosecution can use the spectre of a slimy crafty defence lawyer trying to fool everyone to get his guilty client off the hook to shore up problems in its case the fact that the accused has had previous accusations conveys more statistical knowledge i'm not saying that it is n't probative evidence , but it derails the object of the trial the question is n't whether he did it before , but if he did it this time a serial car thief may not have stolen this particular car there 's a human desire to punish bad people if the accused is shown to be a bad person , then a jury is more likely to convict , regardless of direct evidence of the particular crime in issue
4	banon " it ended really badly we ended up fighting it finished really violently " " we fought on the floor it was n't a case of a couple of slaps i kicked him , he unhooked my bra , he tried to open my jeans " he acted like a " horny monkey " " i said the word ' rape ' to scare him but it did n't seem to scare him much , which suggests he was used to it " that 's not attempted rape ?
4	dsk will never be declared innocent the charges will likely be dismissed if they are not after all that we have learned then the prosecutor should be thrown in prison ( provided no new evidence that does not depend on her testimony comes up ) and dsk will be found not guilty however , for the rest of his life ( even if she admits to lying about this rape ) some people will maintain that he ' got away with it' his name on google will be attached to rape and his reputation will be forever tarnished once a man is accused his name is published and the damage is done nothing will ever fix repair it he is just lucky that he is rich or his life would have essentially been over
6	she maintains that she was raped in guinea , just not as she described when she applied for asylum read the article tbh , people are shocked an immigrant lied to get into the country ? what is rich is that there was a lot of tutting and head shaking on this site when dsk 's history with women ( including previous assault allegations ) was brought up to cast him in a bad light , and now the character assassination of the alleged victim begins and reddit throws itself behind the attacks on her whole heartedly ? the hypocrisy is staggering if we were n't allowed to judge dsk when all the info in the media counted against him , why the hell is judging the victim so flagrantly permissible ?
4	her lawyer also claims that vaginal bruising and a torn ligament ( http www reddit com r worldnews comments iekhf the strausskahn rape case probably isnt going ) were revealed in a forensic exam ( which will come out in court ) there is evidence of dsk 's sperm all over the place , leading to a claim of consensual sex on the part of dsk it may be difficult to reconcile consensual sex with any injuries plus she is the <> person to accuse dsk of attempted rape , and many more have claimed groping it is improbable that an non assaulter would be followed by a string of unconnected assault accusations one , maybe it is much likelier that a serial assaulter would be followed by such a string
4	here 's the same logic , from the opposite direction irrelevant the witness is not the one on trial the witness is not the one who will be sent to jail the witness does not already have a massive prejudice against her due to being the accused the witness does not get the protection of the ban on bad character evidence evidence of the bad character of the accused is tightly controlled and permitted in only very restrictive circumstances this is to ensure a fair trial of the facts in issue and if x is large enough , they convict psychology of juries does not work this way in cases of jury nullification , considerations outside of the actual facts in issue and the evidence of those facts weighs in to convince jurors not to convict this is also not how the law works juries are explicitly instructed that " reasonable doubt " makes no reference to statistical probability juries are instructed that if they think the accused is probably guilty , or likely guilty , then they must acquit him a criminal conviction based on " probable guilt " is an invalid conviction it will tend to produce a pattern of convictions that more closely matches patterns of guilt and you miss the point of the entire concept of a fair trial and justice the object of the justice system is not to produce patterns of conviction that line up with statistics within a margin of error the object is to punish the guilty and to let the innocent go free the object is that it 's better to let <> guilty people go free than to convict a single innocent person a miscarriage of justice is not a statistical outlier , it is a fundamental failure of the entire system and calls its legitimacy into question grandma is really unlikely to be even charged of car theft because the people laying the charge possess the bias you 've just expressed , regardless of her actual guilt the greasy punk will always be accused because he 's a greasy punk it is easier to convict a greasy punk because , while he may not be guilty of this specific thing , he 's probably guilty of something and who cares , right ? this is n't the development of systems and rules that feel good , this is a recognition based on centuries of experience handed down through case law and history of how people think and the psychology of criminality on all sides the psychology of the criminal , of the judge , lawyers , cops and especially of juries and the public at large the justice system does not exist in a controlled environment it cannot , due to fundamental principles of democracy that demand openness and abhor secret trials the starting point from which you view perceived flaws in the truth seeking purpose of trials is wrong

1	first of all , i love that they get an incredibly accurate translation of this unique dialect complete with american phrases ( " he 's got money " ) oh i forgot , we all have spent lots of time in guinea studying the languages also , i get that her credibility is shot because her " story has changed " and she lied about getting into the country but they 're leaving out the circumstances she 's not seeking asylum from a relaxed , well established country , she 's seeking asylum from fucking guinea , one of the poorest countries in the world and as far as her story changing how are they treating this woman ? do you think she gets to go home at night and relax ? she 's probably being badgered day and night and knows her citizenship is hanging in the balance people need to watch more svu mariska hargitay would never let this shit happen
4	nothing proves it ummm ? how about physical evidence from the scene and the testimony of the parties alleged to be involved ? ha ! that 's my entire point ! eyewitness testimony is hideously unreliable ( http agora stanford edu sjls issue <> fisher & tversky htm ) , but the defense may not provide scientific evidence of this unreliability to the jury as for physical evidence , this too can be faked do you note how the defenders of dsk claim that the maid stole his sperm , and caused her own injuries ? the judicial system of standards evidence came into play before the advent of modern statistics , and before our knowledge of the frailty of human memory everything in the court system is already a probabilistic argument is this witness 's memory valid ? is the dna test probative ? was this dna planted ? the fact that the accused has had previous accusations conveys more statistical knowledge i understand that this will never be used , but from the perspective of obtaining a best estimate of the truth , it is valuable information ben stein 's defence of dsk exhibits a most egregious form ben stein is correct in principle , but wrong in application a former car thief is more likely to steal a car than a grandmother in a nursing home but dsk was already notorious for groping , assault , and harassment and there is nothing to suggest that powerful men are inherently ethical , as stein suggests
4	hum , such an excercise of statistics has no meaning without understanding of the system and its degrees of freedom here 's a simple form that can be plugged into a straighforward bayesian reasoning chain <> what fraction of men are rapists ? <> what fraction repeat their rapes , and how often ? ie , what is the typical rape rate ? <> what is the probability that an innocent person is accused of rape , the innocent accusation rate ? <> given two unrelated rape accusations what are the probabilities that <> ) person belongs to the rapist class <> ) person committed this rape , given his probabilistic membership in rapist class ? taking into account all cross terms , of course , like " rapist but not this rape " or " not previous rapist but this rape " this is a solvable math problem if you do n't know the inputs , use ranges or distributions for them your point about the system not being characterized fully is valid , but this is a problem that the courts deal with every day they evade it by avoiding placing numerical bounds on their likelihoods , and producing yes no answers instead of more honest maybes the answer of " we think that there is a <> chance that suspect x is guilty , so we will lock him away for <> years " is socially unacceptable so we embrace a myth of ' beyond reasonable doubt ' after objectively sic weighing the evidence , instead i agree that this sort of reasoning will never be used in court , because the court system is not interested in being fully honest , because this would bring painful truths to the surface it is interested in creating a socially comfortable illusion of objectivity and infallibility
4	can we use her proven history of lying to say she was much more likely to be lying about being raped ? that is what is happening , with the prosecution being pulled back and dsk being released from bail it 's a reasonable question to ask a witness with a history of lying is less credible than one without such a history thank you for demonstrating the validity of this type of inference for her credibility , the issue is what is the likelihood that a person who has lied about immigration matters and did not give a full and honest accounting of her actions after a purported rape would lie about the rape itself ? for his credibility , the issue is what is the likelihood that an man without a propensity to rape would be plagued with an succession of independent rape and assault allegations ? so quit making the same argument about him , thanks i just said " yes " to your question you did not perchance make make a sarcastic remark after incorrectly presupposing my answer to your rhetorical question , did you ? that would make you look very , very silly you should wait for my answer before criticizing me for it !
4	physical signs of rough sex fixed that for you it 's not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was , as a matter of fact , a rape that 's what the courts are for , and the courts ( in this case the prosecutors ) have decided that her initial story is n't what it seems the court of public opinion may have convicted him as a rapist , but reality and what a bunch of people who 'd like nothing more than to see a powerful man go down believe to be true do n't always agree
4	it 's unfortunate that she felt she needed to embellish the rape did you read the whole letter ( http www nytimes com interactive <> <> <> nyregion <> strauss kahn letter html ? hp ) ? please do , it is very illuminating if a rape had really happened , there was no need to ' embellish ' anything , so why lying in the first place ? what if she had ' embellished ' also the dsk rape story ? she has proven to be a liar , and the conversation with her buddy in jail proves she was fully determined to get maximum profit from her current situation i do not like dsk as a person , or for his role in the imf but throwing him in jail for a rape he did not commit is not my idea of fairness on a separate note , i was travelling abroad some weeks ago , and declined to stay in the sofitel ( do not trust maids there ) true story

6	do n't be fooled by the attorney what attorneys claim outside the court is pretty worthless as their claims have n't been examined nor debated m thompson knows his case is toast , all he does is damage control remember that it 's the same guy who presented his client as a perfect employee and hard working citizen beyond any reproach now we know for sure this presentation is pretty far from the reality , and it would even seem that she actually sometimes works as a hooker in the sofitel hotel besides being a maid nothing proves that these alleged bruises happened during the alleged assault in fact , she talked about the torn ligament only days after the events as for the accusations of mrs banon in france , they relate an assault attempt that supposedly happened <> years ago they have never been examined in court , and of course there is absolutely no proof whatsoever so of course it ca n't be ruled out , but that is to take with a pinch of salt and btw she works for a website that leans heavily to the right wing , and therefore would see dsk as the biggest threat to sarkozy for presidential elections coming back to what happened in that suite , if we consider that she in fact was a hooker , this changes a lot our perspective m strauss kahn was not a first timer in this hotel he probably knew that several maids could offer some special services that go well beyond the basics of cleaning the room it could very well be that she offered her special services to m strauss kahn , hence a lot of male dna spread everywhere , and decided to take advantage of him otoh , even if he knew she was not a mere maid , he may have tried to abuse her and rape her , but then since nobody knows what really happened , it 's word against word and at this game , the liar loses
4	if we were n't allowed to judge dsk when all the info in the media counted against him , why the hell is judging the victim so flagrantly permissible ? for the same reason that people judged him people like to judge other people and will jump on any past mistakes as absolute proof of wrong doing far too many people believe that ' where there is smoke , there is fire ' this is why the names of both the accuser and the accused must be protected from the press until after the trial concludes with a guilty verdict
4	nagy is not hearsay christophe deloire and christophe dubois are journalists and authors , relying on interviews aurelie filipetti is a first person account sounds like the typical hearsay you get whenever anyone gets accused of a crime i am familiar with no such ' typical hearsay ' and these are all from before the accusation , not afterwards as you suggest
6	what ? from the nyt article linked to in this post " the housekeeper also told investigators that she had been gang raped in guinea she cried and became " markedly distraught when recounting the incident , " according to a letter to the defense from prosecutors released friday but she later admitted that that , too , was a lie , once again one she had told to help her application for asylum she said she was indeed raped in guinea , but not in the way she had described " it 's unfortunate that she felt she needed to embellish the rape as if that 's even possible in order to gain asylum , but she was desperate , and that was the story she told that does n't make it a lie , nor does it not make her a victim
2	the torn ligament is something new that the complainant brought up to the prosecution only this past week it 's most likely bullshit , and another example of discrediting her character and with it , the entire case
4	because a history of assault allegations is taken to be proof of the current allegations , while it is no such thing this is a problem with using the legal rather than scientific statistical evidence of ' proof ' the legal system gives the defendant the benefit of the doubt in certain ways ( excluding a criminal history that statistically makes him more likely to be the sort who commits crimes ) , but also subjects the defendant to evidence that does not pass scientific muster ( bite mark evidence , eyewitness testimony ) then a jury of mediocrities ( or sub mediocrities , after the selection process ) is given the task of analyzing this evidence , without being allowed even to take notes that he groped women does not prove he raped this woman at this time and place it does not prove it nothing proves it but it establishes a probability that this is a person who does this sort of thing that 's genuine information by using quantitative knowledge of how rapists repeat their crimes , you can plug this into a rigorous bayesian formula ( as good but not better than its inputs ) , along with other knowledge , to figure out that there is a ( for example ) <> chance he 's guilty then you decide if the remaining <> constitutes 're asonable doubt ' this is how a scientific paper on dsk would work but this kind of logic is anathema to the courts , which substitute a different set of logic that they pretend is somehow better , because it feels more emotionally satisfying
2	that may absolutely be true , but it 's still evidence that can be put to the test this stuff about propensity and " he did it before " and statistics and so on that 's a load of bullshit and is not evidence of the crime alleged
4	but it establishes a probability that this is a person who does this sort of thing this is explicitly forbidden evidence in a courtroom , especially before a jury the danger of the misuse of this evidence is incredibly high there must be substantial probative value before this evidence is admitted you assail the standard of proof used in a court room and hold up a scientific statistical model of evidence as being superior you deride the judicial model as being " pretend " and trivialize the mountains of experience behind its development as merely " emotionally satisfying " you really do n't understand politics and psychology , do you ? nothing proves it ummm ? how about physical evidence from the scene and the testimony of the parties alleged to be involved ? you do see the danger of this statistical evidence , right ? you exhibit one of its primary dangers that it comes cloaked in the veil of authority of science oh snap , science says he 's probably guilty there is , of course , perversions of your statistical analysis ben stein 's defence of dsk ( http spectator org archives <> <> <> presumed innocent anyone ) exhibits a most egregious form in life , events tend to follow patterns people who commit crimes tend to be criminals , for example can anyone tell me any economists who have been convicted of violent sex crimes ? can anyone tell me of any heads of nonprofit international economic entities who have ever been charged and convicted of violent sexual crimes ? is it likely that just by chance this hotel maid found the only one in this category ? maybe mr strauss kahn is guilty but if so , he is one of a kind , and criminals are not usually one of a kind the issue is not what statistical models say about dsk , the issue is whether there was non consensual sex between him and this maid on the date and in the place alleged no one was there except dsk and the maid physical evidence has been left behind there are also the stories of two humans , the maid and dsk both have motivations both have imperfect perception both have defective memories the maid has complained to the authorities that dsk has committed a crime against her if this is true , then dsk must be punished in accordance with the law our society prizes individual liberty and abhors limiting that freedom without a good reason or so our social theory about ourselves goes so someone has to make a decision about this allegation the decision maker has to sit down and be shown the evidence they have to hear what people have to say for themselves and then they have to make a decision about the truth of an event that none of them were present for and inflict punishment on a man based on their decision about what happened and you deride this system as mere pretend and trivialize its justifications as emotionally satisfying ? go back to the lab , poindexter

3	actual rapes happen far more often than false rape accusations the majority of rapes are committed by either family relatives or close friends of the victim even more , rapes can occur against men too , whether that be by women or other men i ca n't help but think your passion towards this issue is caused by some misplaced fear that you 'll somehow be falsely accused of rape sure false accusations do happen , but you should try finding some support groups of people who were actually raped and hear not only the twisted , gruesome shit that has happened to these people , but how more often than not the scales of justice are tilted against the victims situations like this and the duke lacrosse team are exceptional circumstances and not the norm of reality
2	" there are lots of other ways to explain the <> the evidence so far is that it is drug money laundered by others into her account she seems to be uneducated and naive and , to put it succinctly , an amoral bottom dwelling survivor it does ' t make much sense for a maid to continue working as a maid if she had actual access to the money , rather than simply had an account opened in her name " it does make a lot of sense when she lies about her condition for taxes , and if even more if she is a hotel hooker ( okay , still hypothetical , but the ny post seems to have several converging sources ) " does n't sound that vague " when i say vague , i mean nothing that permits to verify the truth of her allegations she could perfectly make up all this whatever she says the fact is she did n't file anything , and <> days after talking about filing , she said she is n't going to otoh , i expect him to file a case for defamation as soon as he comes back to france btw , she works for atlantico , which is a right wing information web site " why should n't we talk about it ? we can mention the source , and the fact that it is n't confirmed by the prosecution ( who have some obligations to stay out of the media to avoid tainting the trial ) " whatever the attorneys say outside the court is geared towards the media , i e mostly baloney her attorney painted her as a simple working woman without any problem , remember ? well , hardly the case

6	irrelevant the witness is not the one on trial you still do n't see my point i'm not speaking of trials conducted by usa legal rules i'm speaking of probabilities and logical inference the logical method remains valid ( or invalid ) in both instances whether the method is admissible in court in a particular instance is another matter this is to ensure a fair trial of the facts in issue ah ! but my point is that ' fair trial ' is not the same as ' accurate statistical inference of guilt and innocence ' the legal system is very imprecise , and hobbled by rules of procedure and evidence sometimes this hurts the defendant , and sometimes it helps him juries are explicitly instructed that " reasonable doubt " makes no reference to statistical probability ha ! this is an evasion of the issue by math phobes " reasonable doubt " must include some notion of probability otherwise , the instructions would demand certainty for instance , it is always possible that a quantum fluctuation created a precise clone of dsk , who then proceeded to rape the maid while the real dsk was reading the financial times in the next room this is proof that there is a finite though small probability that dsk is innocent , no matter what the evidence therefore no criminal can ever be found guilty of anything if mere ' probability ' of guilt is insufficient to convict qed the object of the justice system is not to produce patterns of conviction that line up with statistics within a margin of error the object is to punish the guilty and to let the innocent go free ha ! that 's the myth , to avoid the complicated truth juries engage in implicit statistical analysis , and when they become sufficiently convinced of guilt ( beyond some internally defined reasonable doubt ) , they convict this is not a comfortable thing to contemplate because if innocence is possible with probability 'p' , then fraction 'p' of prisoners in jail are by construction innocent so we pretend that 're asonable doubt ' does not leave behind a certain ' probability of innocence ' such reasoning would never be allowed in a scientific paper , because it is simply wrong the object is that it 's better to let <> guilty people go free than to convict a single innocent person a miscarriage of justice is not a statistical outlier , it is a fundamental failure of the entire system and calls its legitimacy into question of course ! that 's what we pretend the truth is too hard to bear what is the 're asonable ' in 're asonable doubt ' ? is it that we never convict when we admit the possibility of innocence ? by this argument , any juror should <> ) realize that juries have convicted the innocent <> ) realize he is on a jury , no better or worse than past juries <> ) realize that if he convicts , then he may be one of those jurors who convicts an innocent person <> ) therefore refuse to convict , ever i think that most people are incapable of thinking along such honest statistical lines , so they embrace the myth that ' merely probably guilty ' people are not convicted
4	this is also not how the law works juries are explicitly instructed that " reasonable doubt " makes no reference to statistical probability juries are instructed that if they think the accused is probably guilty , or likely guilty , then they must acquit him a criminal conviction based on " probable guilt " is an invalid conviction is n't the determination of whether " the accused is probably guilty , or likely guilty " fundamentally a question of information certainty and reliability ? surely any attempt to formalize such concepts involves some measure of probability while i might say that i believe some event e occurred at some time t , internally i perceive this statement to be one of probabilty your statement on the legal interpretation of probability is equivalent to suggesting i could not enter any post priori statements or decisions while on a jury because , to me , all post priori statements are fundamentally probabilistic and you miss the point of the entire concept of a fair trial and justice the object of the justice system is not to produce patterns of conviction that line up with statistics within a margin of error the object is to punish the guilty and to let the innocent go free the object is that it 's better to let <> guilty people go free than to convict a single innocent person a miscarriage of justice is not a statistical outlier , it is a fundamental failure of the entire system and calls its legitimacy into question once again , i think you are making statements that do not conform to any rigorous , mathematical worldview anonymous coward 's statement did exclude the necessity for judicial systems to strongly favor false negatives ( letting the guilty go ) over false positives ( jailing the innocent ) taking this into account , it would be simple to create a appropriate weighing function to compare the ' correctness ' of various judicial implementations and while there do exist circumstances where the ideal weighted solution is not the most accurate , i find it dangerous to embark on any real world fact finding without accuracy as a necessary virtue ideally , given enough accuracy ( whether this is judicially possible is another issue altogether ) the need for false positives to be stringently controlled does vanish , although such accuracy very rarely occurs in real life a miscarriage of justice is not a statistical outlier but from a mathematical or statistical perspective it is certainly an outlier , at least for a reliable , accurate process why is your perspective more correct that the mathematical one ?

4	i do n't think personal quarrels and affairs should be publicized , that is all of course no one will agree that affairs , rape , etc are n't serious matters it 's just as terrible , however , how the media launches such sweeping attacks even without a formal verdict i'm simply sick of how often the media ' jumps the gun ' if dsk did in fact force the hotel maid to perform sexual acts then obviously he should be reprimanded far too often , however , have decent politicians been ousted for entirely irrelevant issues i'm openly using hyperbole when i say this , but who cares if a pervert is in office if he 's doing a damn good job ? i guess that is politics though top wall street officials can dance around with their prostitutes all they want and no one bothers as soon as a politician lays even a hand on a woman other than his wife he 's dubbed as an evil doer
4	it 's a somber thought knowing that your position as the head of the imf and potentially as future president of france ( or why not just generalize and say all political life ) have been ruined based on meager , unsubstantiated claims it is pathetic to see how the media immediately jumped to such tremendous claims without waiting for legitimate court rulings and evidence need i mention the complete disregard for french law by publishing photos of dsk in handcuffs ? my hat goes off to dsk , given he is declared innocent i believe he is i cannot fathom what it must be like to have one 's career so seemingly beaten down to a pulp by the repugnant fists of the media seeking after 'a good headline '
4	sure , this is a valid approach if you have a data set as input to build your chain , and another data set to validate your approach where will you get such a ( known good ) data set ? the academic and police literature , on the subject of rape now i do n't see why you need two sets , rather than peer reviewed estimates from the body of criminal science you would get probability distributions ( error bounds ) for your inputs , and you 'd integrate over them to get your final answer let me clarify my beliefs here that there is nothing wrong with bayesian methods , but there is a problem with implementing it in this case i agree with many of your qualms for political and psychological reasons , i think we will never let go the myths that underly today 's justice system this bayesian argument should not be the deciding factor , either it could be only one additional weight that is given to the jury , to consider along with the evidence for this circumstance surely , the opposite is done all the time " ladies and gentlemen of the jury , do you think that this upstanding citizen standing before you , a man unsullied by previous accusations , would commit such a crime ? " the logic is already embraced , but only in one direction do i expect this sort of reasoning to be applied in the courts ? no do i see it as a valid way of thinking about innocence and guilt outside the courts ? yes
4	in the hypothesis that the ump would have had something to do with it , the essential point would have been to discredit dsk , not necessarily to have put him behind bars for years of course , the main concern would be that it could not be traced back this said , i suppose the nypd cyrus vance made some phone calls and french government embassy said " do as you please , we wo n't interfere " the opportunity was too good to be true
4	you decided to change " physical signs of rape " into " physical signs of rough sex " for no reason other than the fact that you 'd prefer this to be the case the police found blood at the scene that sounds like more than just " rough sex " are you going to contrive some explanation about the maid being into s & m ?
4	no , my point was that just because she has a history of lying does not mean she was not raped that 's not my point either i'm saying that the likelihood that that she is telling the truth is decreased by her past lies i noticed you edited your remark from can we use her proven history of lying to say she was much more likely to be lying about being raped ? to can we use her proven history of lying to state she was lying about being raped ? you deliberately modified the bit relevant to my point , and to which i responded , and now you 're pretending you said something else ! innocent until proven guilty you communist oh my !

4	a proxy with a static ip ? it 's probably an anycast setup , and they have a bunch of proxies with the same address ( that is why it needs to be in the private range ) then , they block web traffic from their public addressing space , and you would be ' forced ' to go via the proxy looks like they are trying the chinese way
4	thanks for generalizing an entire country bro , you must be really smart
4	seriously being single was like being in prison health & welfare inspections are awesome !
4	i understand their position , but they did violate the ucmj and they got caught the corps cannot ignore that and choose not to charge them because their actions might be understandable however , if the " selling " of benefits is a rampant practice amongst members of the service and not actively investigated and prosecuted , one could certainly make the argument that this prosecution is selective enforcement in the civilian system , that might get a case thrown out how that works in the military i'm unsure of their real mistake was both of them marrying marines it seems like it went from skirting regulations to outright fraud when it became both
4	one of the reasons i got out singles get treated like shit there was so much incentive to shack up that there 's literally a cottage industry that revolves around marrying service members to split the benefits
4	two of my good friends married to get the benefits him the extra income and for her the medical
6	why would they ever let anyone from nk be involved in the un ?
4	duh china is babysitting its own facebook dittoes , like renren , until they grow large enough that their network effect can reasonably compete with that of facebook btw , if you do n't know what a network effect is , stop wining about what the chinese gov ' t is doing and start reading wikipedia
6	the chinese will do this with every " social network " site unless it " approves " them what that entitles is giving the chinese government access <> <> , with the ability to take down the site content as they see fit of course no one would allow that , except the chinese government chinese based social networks was n't a big surprised
6	the government bans any form of ( usually foreign ) social media they have no direct control over ( and imdb , for some reason ) google and gmail are periodically spotty , so this does n't come as much of a surprise they get away with doing it without too much protest because there 's usually a chinese copy available
4	the good news is this is fantastic for google this gets their name out there , lets people believe it 'll have power
1	protectionism ? the fuck are you smoking ? this is straight denying freedom of speech and a personal vendetta against google
6	imdb was banned originally for a movie it listed about the tibean issue then it was reallowed and about a month later banned again , not sure why the second one but , surprise surprise , china has thier own version now so do n't worry
4	it 's also protectionism , so was facebook and youtube and twitter chinese government does not like competitors in it 's media sector
4	i think this 'll have a rebellious efect on it , like " oh this google was banned in china , i'm gonna try it out ! " sort of thing
6	why would someone that can afford a better car opt to get this car using this program ?
4	i'm just saying we should n't look down on them for having so many kids it 's not like people living in rural india even have an income that they can save
4	unless you save for retirement seriously , the only alternatives are n't " live off your kids " or " get the government to force everyone younger than you to support you " people used to put away their own money for their own retirement it 's still possible , and still a good idea that aside , the sterilization program does n't mention wanting people to have no children it mentions people having no more children so i'm unclear on how your comment relates to mine have the number of kids you want , then stop , and maybe get a new tv while you 're at it
4	i really do n't think most peoples impulses are so bad that they 'll agree to getting surgery done on their junk without a modicum of thought , and those that do deserve to live with the consequences , as horrible as that sounds plus , if everyone with bad impulses got themselves sterilized would n't this have the result of breeding better impulse control ? it 's almost like claiming your own darwin award
4	i similarly think it would be a good plan to make iuds free to everyone , including teenagers it would temporarily ( <> years ) sterilize people who do n't want to be parents , and so who probably should n't be parents at that time and it would be entirely non coercive and lack obvious exploitation
4	while authorities claim they have not received any complaints about the campaign , family planning advocates from the non profit population foundation of india are not enamored with the plan , telling afp it amounted to " coercion by a different name " ugh it 's not coercive , there 's no guaranteed pay off , considering how few items are being raffled off and how many people they hope to enter in their raffle the incentive seems more symbolic than anything but god forbid anyone feel there 's an extra reason to get sterilized ! why , that 's , that 's what 's a good scary word coercive ! this seems like an entirely reasonable , no pressure way to encourage people to get sterilized now rather than later if they keep up the raffles , they may manage an entirely voluntary increase in the rate at which people stop risking pregnancy in pretty much every aspect , it 's laudable but it will mean fewer cuddly babies , so apparently it must be fought , with lies and misinformation if necessary i 'll say again ugh
1	if my future was determined by the stupid shit i did when i was young , i 'd be fucked
4	i actually find that disturbing i have no problem with readily available contraceptives , but this is too permanent plus , i like this line " if there is electricity in every village , then people will watch tv till late at night and then fall asleep they won t get a chance to produce children , " mr azad said at the time " when there is no electricity , there is nothing else to do but produce babies
4	this actualy seems like quite a good idea
2	why the implication that only the poor would take advantage of financial incentives ? even if you already have whatever they 're raffling off , there 's no harm in getting another free one
4	in countries like india , your children are your retirement plan unlike western nations , there are n't many social welfare programs , so when you 're too old to work , your kids take care of you if you do n't have kids , you 'll just die when you get too old to work
2	i'm not looking down on people in rural india who have no alternatives in ensuring their survival in old age i'm looking down on " the non profit population foundation of india " , who seem to view people having fewer children as intrinsically bad , regardless of the situation or personal choice i guess i'm also looking down on the octomom , and others like her , who try to make prodigious breeding out as some sort of virtue unrelated , i know , but i just really hate those people utterly irresponsible and destructive
4	no , what i'm implying is that those people silly enough to gamble their fertility away are less likely to be the kind of people emotionally mature enough to provide a stable family atmosphere , so voluntary self sterilization is a fitting end
6	they 're raffling off one car i doubt that 'll change the perception of them so much that it 'll be assumed that if you drive one , you 're poor and ball less also , do you know how sterilization works ? for ones done on males , all that 's done is that the vans deferens ( tubes connecting your balls to your urethra ) are cut and closed off you still have balls and in case you missed it go party crashing , smash it with a sledgehammer to work off stress there are still uses for free things , even if they wo n't sell well and you can afford better ones why turn your nose up at them ?
6	there are plenty of people that gamble away their life 's savings , homes , families what makes you think their fertility would be any different ?
6	why would i bother ? if it has some truth in it i will see it reported on the bbc or nytimes or some other well reputed newssite
4	those jokes are always made when the idea comes up i'm not trying to argue that the article is suggesting it or that the defense will suggest it or anything silly like that , i'm just trying to head it off at the pass because reddit 's full of people who think it 's hysterical
4	here 's one possible narrative strauss kahn solicited a prostitute who decided afterwards to blackmail him being french and perfectly okay with soliciting prostitutes , he likely rebuffed the blackmail she then came up with the story about how he had raped her as a means of revenge and possible restitution
4	we already have misogynists on reddit assuming that it probably did n't happen because he could afford to pay for better , now she 's alleged to have worked as a prostitute so i imagine we 'll see people taking this as fact ( because " a source close to the defense " is known as a reliable guy ) and assume she 's a vindictive hooker looking for a big score while making the occasional joke about raping a prostitute only being theft i have n't been following this case so i do n't know a lot about it , i could n't have less of an idea if this dude is guilty or not and the article mentions some things from the district attorney that certainly damage the woman 's credibility assuming they 're true but the alleged prostitution rumour being published without any corroborating evidence is lazy , prejudicial faux journalism that reinforces the misogyny inherent in a lot of these kinds of cases involving rich , powerful men and will only serve to bolster the sort of people who immediately dismiss an accusation like this as the work of money grubbing attention whores
4	the daily mail may have a very right wing stance , but they are nothing like fox news at least they report the truth horribly spun rather than downright lies
4	actually , israel is n't a signatory of the fourth geneva convention ( but it 's probably jus cogens anyway ) however it does not forbid collective punishment it forbids punishing civilians instead of the military in the wars of today where there 's a hazy line between who 's a soldier and who 's a civilian ( and they all dress alike ) the geneva convention is n't an easy thing to follow there 's is a distinction since humanitarian aid gets trough and military aid does n't goldstone at least claims israel did not attempt to harm civilians , see his article it the post from earlier this year there 's also a question about the type of punishment you ca n't impose criminal like punishments , and you ca n't argue a blockade is a criminal like punishment you can impose a navy blockade of any state you 're at war with , unless you control their territory the division of israel controlling the air and water of gaza follows the oslo accords , but hamas controls the actual territory
4	while i may not agree with any political motivations behind the ban on allowing the flottilla ship to leave port , it is in fact illegal to leave port without the proper authorization , and there 's a good chance leaving port requires having a port pilot on board to safely comply with local regulations additionally , that ship is not equipped designed to safely transport <> people and supplies now it may have had less on board , but ships capsize from being poorly loaded entirely too often when a ship leaves port they have to have file paperwork that states its exact loading conditions , and has to state that these conditions are within the ships safe design conditions additionally , approval is required allowing ships to leave port without being safely loaded , or without a port pilot to safely maneuver through a congested port is dangerous had the greek gov ' t allowed the ship to do leave , and it had capsized , we would be reading an article about how the greek gov ' t allowed the deaths of <> people , instead of how it brought them safely back to port again , i do n't agree with holding a ship in port for political reasons , and while that may be the case here it is also possible that the ship was unsafe and , for the record , a ship leaving port without the approval of the port , is similar to an airplane taking off from jfk without air traffic controls approval it could end so poorly it 's not worth doing
4	there are various reports by human rights organizations like amnesty international , human rights watch , and physicians for human rights that have also come to the conclusion that israel deliberately targets civilians so it 's not just the un
5	this is the list of items that are not permitted the post you cited is either incorrect or a lie his sources are all outdated at the end of june <> israel significantly eased the blockade his sources are all from before that this is the actual list of items banned from gaza http www mfa gov il mfa humanitarianaid palestinians lists controlled entry items <> jul <> htm johnfpublics list is outdated , truly sad to see reddit cluelessly upvoting it
8	i'm sorry , but the fact that israel delivers cloths does not contradict the claim that cloths are banned ? here is a claim made by that post " at one time all of the following was either outright banned or restricted by israel " here is what is actually said in the link provided for the post " crayons , stationary , soccer balls , and musical instruments have been , at times , banned for import " it then goes on to say that other reports claim they are not banned so how is it not a contradiction when the article used claims almost exactly the opposite of what the poster is claiming ? if you go even further you will see that the list of materials is based on what many palestinian business men deem is being banned now i am sure many items are banned , but this list used is no way official all one needs to do is claim that they were not allowed to have something shipped and it 's on the list it does n't require any kind of proof for the reason but somehow you already decided it was banned without even bothering to research the links the reason for that is the real issue at hand
4	that 's funny because the un supervised the cargo from the last flotilla group and when you say the un , i think you mean certain parties in the un ? the reason it 's hard to deliver construction material is because hamas keeps taking that material and using it for military purposes if hamas would stop making its goal to attack israel , they would n't have to put restrictions on building material as for your request i did a google search and came up with hundreds of links to examples the biggest one as mentioned was the last flotilla which everyone was up in arms about , so here is one of the <> of result pages http www humanistnewswire com <> <> irin middle east israel opt flotilla html
3	or if you ask israel , all palestinians are terrorists see , not targeting civilians ) u mad ?
4	yea really why should only one side be armed ? why should the israelis be able to shoot palestinians like fish in a barrel ?
6	yeah really why ?
4	the fact of the matter is that israel provides more humanitarian aid to gaza than anyone else that 's like a farmer feeding his animals israel feeds the palestinians which they view as their animals who are kept in small corrals in order to keep them alive the point is to make their palestinians dependent on them and only them for their very survival if they allowed just anybody to deliver goods into gaza the people of gaza might eat foods israel does not want them to eat and might not be dependent on israel for their lives israel ca n't live with that possibility the palestinians must be dependent on them for their very lives
4	it 's a protest you know like the protests in syria and bahrain like syria and bahrain , israel shoots at protestors and kills some of them
6	why should only one side of this conflict be armed ? really ?
1	israel is doing what it needs to defend itself good thing for greece for being level headed , a lot of blood could have been spilled violating a naval blockade this shit happened last year , fuckwits never learn
8	hamas and organizations like it do n't believe infidels have the right to live on any land that muslims conquered at any point in history they 'll never be content with just palestine it 's just a cute rallying cry to garner sympathy from the starbucks socialists
4	because it 's not true this claim comes from an article that was reporting a temporary incident during a conflict what they 're trying to do is make you think that israel has a policy on not allowing water or water purification systems when israel in fact has been helping gaza develop such systems right now they are working on pipelines between israel and gaza so they can help treat the waste while providing extra clean water but that article being from <> would n't mention that nor does the poster mention the conflict at the time that was the center of the actual issue all that is mentioned is israel denies water purification is that very honest ? what kind of crime is it to leave out important information in an attempt to mislead readers ? sorta like how in march this year a flotilla full of weapons and missiles was stopped by the israeli naval blockade but no one seems to have any problem with that i just really really wish people would actually read the articles they are using for these claims i wish they would follow the links to the very sources anyone can do this you go to the article , you click on it 's source , follow it 's source , until you get to the original story and that 's just assuming the direct article the poster read is being dishonest and leaving this information out as if they are getting it from a reputable news source , such information would have been included should it not be important to note that gaza now has treatment plants ? they did just before that article was published too , but the battle at that time between hamas and israel damaged a lot of the piping just to put things in perspective in the <> quarter of <> , just before the big flotilla incident israel delivered <> , <> tons of supplies to gaza including <> billion gallons of purified water <> , <> tons of wheat <> , <> tons of rice <> , <> tons of clothes and footwear <> tons of milk powder and baby food <> , <> head of cattle into gaza <> , <> tons of medical equipment and medicine that 's just in one <> month period the flotilla that everyone loves to talk about brought a couple of tons of expired medical supplies http www mfa gov il mfa about the ministry behind the headlines israeli humanitarian lifeline gaza <> may <> htm
3	<> ) in the <> day war isreal was not attacked or invaded <> ) the palestinian people were not one of the potential aggressors <> ) countries do n't usually keep the land they gain in a defensive war , france did n't keep part of germany , now if you want to model yourselves after the ussr then it does make more sense <> ) if you are going to talk about how many innocent israelis have died ( about <> , <> since september <> ) you should consider the <> , <> palestinians , in fact more palestinian children have died <> , <> than all israelis put together i 'd also debate the no reason <> ) it is important to remember that zionist terrorism was used to help found israel ( for reference <> innocent brits died ) <> ) it should be noted that the only claim jews have to palestine is from a fictional book
4	they get to keep that piece of land yes , in the <> , that was true two world wars later the human race realized that this was n't such a bright idea , and it is very much illegal under international law to annex land by use of force to stop the missiles coming into the territory , they blockaded it so that 's why pasta and musical instruments were banned from being imported ? too much risk of penne bombs being dropped on israel ? or maybe flying guitars ? put any other country 's name in place of israel 's , like say the united states , and imagine what would happen ? please the united states has consistently been criticised for its foreign policy and for its involvement in several wars do n't you think that the u s would pulverize and " shock and awe " anybody who did that to them ? how would that make it right ? collective punishment is wrong no matter what the circumstances if you want to talk about warcrimes , how about you talk about how many innocent israelis have had to die for no reason ? when israel invaded gaza in <> , killing <> , <> people the majority of whom were civilians , around <> had died in the span of <> years as a result of rocket fire
4	yes would you like some intellectual assistance in working out why it is still considered to be occupied ? i have my explanations ready if the task is too much for you
6	it 's also based on a single humanitarian group that does n't make the claims of that group wrong , but it 's just the take of a single group who is known for being on one side their intention is to do everything they can to paint israel in the worst light and gaza in the best and what aggregation ? they do n't explain any requirements for what goes on their list all one has to do is be a palestinian businessman who says they were not allowed to get an item if one guy could n't get some chocolate , it 's on the list and now we can claim that israel bans chocolate i am sure many of the claims on their list are legitimate and i would n't dismiss them simply because they have a bias , but at the same time , i cannot conclude that israel bands all of these things using just their criteria especially when some of them have been demonstrated to be incorrect a major part of the problem is that hamas does anything it can to launch attacks on israel and as a result the innocent people have to suffer many items have dual uses and if it can be used for building weapons ( many foods can be ) then hamas does it all they have to do is stop attacking israel has made steps towards a peaceful goal such as easing up the restrictions when some of them were pointed out to be completely uneeded they gave back gaza because they agrees that it no longer qualifies as a buffer zone once you start building on it they even gave all the buildings in tact to the palestinians what did hamas do ? it destroyed all of the infrastructure the jews built in gaza because it was built by jews so they destroyed that infrastructure , and now have to depend more on israel but to many here that 's israel 's fault
4	so parts are counted as exports , and completed machines are exports , but not machines that are almost assembled from parts ? personal experience the internet likes citations otherwise , the internet might think you 're full of shit
4	he spent <> years of his life in the us , it is a well known fact you can call me a conspiracy theory for as much as you like but i am absolutely convinced that he likes the us israel alliance in the case , he did not exactly commit treason , but he did took sides in my opinion , greece should probably remain neutral , as other countries around try to do
1	i 've actually upvoted you on all accounts for your efforts to commit yourself to a reasonable debate , which unfortunately for you , you are not bound to have with me this is simply due to me being bored stupid and lacking facts off the top of my head to use as arguments i have an opinion , which is comprised of my own personal experiences my esteemed opinion of the usa is that it is a country full of loud mouthed buffoons who actually believe their cool aid of being the greatest nation on the world us capitalist foreign policies towards the third world are those of an imperialist vasall state economy that will tolerate genocide abroad , as long as it serves your own interests i hate the bipartisan political system filled with constituents who are loud mouthed morons , appeasing loud mouthed morons while lining their pockets with corporate money i hate feeling unsafe in the us i hate the lack of culture and the way you abuse your poor i hate your penal system even though i am not a criminal the usa was founded on some great principles which are today being abused and anyone who questions the course of action is quickly labled un american i fucking hate so much about the us but at the same time i love a lot as well but if me hating on stupid loud mouthed americans can make them think about " why they no like us ? " for just a second , i 've had some small impact americans like to go parade around how great they are when most of them are poorly educated with a very narrow insight into world politics and happenings this is not a matter of jealousy its pity i'm from central europe and have lived in the us as well
2	it 's a universal thing really , everyone hates jews wonder why that is , because you 're such glorious people ? or because you 're the scum of the earth ? stealing other people 's land is definitely a move only jewish character could stand behind i applaud your shameless exhibition of zealotry and ignorance turkey will wipe the floor with you should it come to blows compare turks ' military history with jewish oh wait , you 've only been a country ( if squatting qualifies for such an equivalence ) for the last <> years , you have no history
1	do n't get angry mate it 's just a simple conversation think of it this way , there is absolutely nothing you can do to stop us from boycotting israel we do it because it works if it did not work , you ( and people like you ) would n't be so fretful of the idea i believe anonymous coward already deflated part of your argument about the israeli economy you 're starting to bore me , so whatever you say next , make sure it worthy of a response
4	missles from iran is the propaganda they tell you while trying to divide , demoralize and destroy the will of the palestinians you can try to create a nanny state to watch over the palestinians to prevent them gaining arms , but you 'll never stop them from getting around the blockade the flotillas are a spearhead of international goodwill to the palestinians and their plight the world supports them having basic rights no group of people should be collectively punished the way to increased safety and protection from rockets is to make peace with the palestinians not confining them like a bunch of dangerous animals and how do you make peace ? start by freezing the settlement ( well you might need to get rid of netanyahu ) the world is at a time with many right wing governments in control , its easy to let fear guide us and dehumanize the people we fear but we must recognize this for what it is these hardliners are n't going to solve these problems , at best they 'll keep the status quo
6	the patriots of '76 hid among civilians what are they supposed to do , gather in an open field with targets on their backs ?
6	these boats are not there to deliver humanitarian aid , they are there to violate a naval blockade of course its not about delivering humanitarian aid it 's about the only effective weapon the palestinians have , publicity its gets people asking why is israel blockading gaza ? why is israel so brutal ? from that that a question a whole host of awkward questions flow why do the palestinians fire rockets ? why is malnutrition rife in gaza ? what are the palestinians upset about ? why has this dragged on for <> years whats israel doing in the west bank ? the flotilla is a legitimate way to garner publicity for their cause and raising awareness of the issues this is what israel fears , the worlds attention turning on the question of what israel is doing to the palestinians
1	or , you know , israel could try and make peace so that so that people would n't want to fire missiles at them your argument is basically that you 've locked someone in a room , and you are angry that people come and try to give him food without letting you inspect it , because someone might give him a gun that he 'll shoot you with , and would n't it be much worse if you had to shoot him now to defend yourself
1	israels blockade is fucking atrocious i deal with a company that tried to deliver a machine designed to clean water using solar uv technology for the kids in gaza as part of a charity , and the israelis blocked it fucking stopping kids having access to clean water why aren t the locals seeing common sense and seeing what they are doing ? we have seen in the past what happens when you stand back and don t step up and pressure the govnt
8	i do n't know what israel is trying to do by flexing it muscles irrationally in this way all it is doing is breeding more distrust and more hatred toward the people of israel i have nothing against jews and i have nothing against the citizens of israel i know they are just people like every other people in the world and i try to defend them against unjust attacks that are made against them all over the internet but my sympathy is wearing thin and i'm starting to feel inclined to join the growing uproar that is turning against everything israeli i look and see how they are waging battle against the most hungry most poor most destitute and i'm sorry but my empathy for the people of israel has pretty much run out it 's time for jews to overthrow the zionists
1	this is all due to israel , and has absolutely nothing to do with the actual boats seaworthiness or endangering the passengers , because the freedom flottila is infallible and has no flaws we all know that it 's because they 're against israel and for palestine , so it 's clear ! evil jews at work again , i'm sure sigh fucking reddit
1	good fuck the palies
4	looks like zeus is the more powerful god sucks to find out you wasted your life on the wrong religion
4	talk about piling on unrelated charges it 's not like they had enough legal footing to stop the sailors anyway waiting on the second turkish flotilla to head for gaza , escorted by turkish naval ships we 'll see what 's going to happen then
1	please take your sock puppeting elsewhere gaza is clearly collective punishment of people a who are angry at people b about being systematically deprived of a homeland by people b people b have more force and have oppressive discriminatory practices , and have been perpetrating injustice for <> years thousands of years of history of co deprivation to the peoples who share this rock are irrelevant to current evil
3	yes , but it 's quite curious how hard they 're " going at it " , like the captain is a wanted murderer or terrorist
2	a very small , specific group of jewish sinners from the time of moses do you think any of them are still alive today ? what about matthew <> <> ? look , just be open about it you hate muslims do n't try to rationalize it
1	because the palestinians are waging war , not israel , dumbfuck , israel does not recognize this as a war unilateral actions of israel have probably saved hundreds of thousands of palestinian lives you mean they did n't kill as many people as they could have i wonder if that would work in murder trials see officer , i could have killed a dozen people but i only killed one so i am the good guy !
4	there are always exceptions just like there are palestinians who know co existance with israel is the only way to go
4	and this is a good reason to act like asses and make everyone even angrier , somehow ?
6	what is israel supposed to do ? stop driving a wedge between jews and the rest of humanity there 's no such thing as a jewish state , anymore than a mohican , left handed or gay state
3	failed policy ? the security fence and the gaza blockade have substantially reduced the number of terror attacks , and accordingly , the number of dead israelis it did what numerous negotiation efforts could not in the long term there may be sustainability issues but , from an israeli perspective , you 'd have a hard time making a case that the policy is failed and since it is they who set policy , appealing to them rather than parroting the hivemind soundbyte is what you need to do if you care about change , not just comment karma
1	it 's like this , my foreign friend america is <> you being a foreigner are our personal fucking dog our corrupt fucking politicians send your shit incompetent government our hard earned tax dollars every month so why do n't you do us all a favor and shut your whore fucking mouth the american tax paying citizen owns your bitch ass so kindly do us all a favor and go fuck your whore fucking mother up her asshole if you get out of line , and piss off corporate america , our military will be sent to your country to " bring teh peace and democracies " snicker to your people fucking piece of shit foreigner i as an american tax payer own your fucking bitch ass so now i command you to sing for me i will stalk you on reddit until your bitch ass fucking sings for my american amusement sing me a motherfucking song you stupid fucking savage ! ! !
4	i'm not an arab but i 'd expect just this attitude from an ignorant jew like yourself
4	the purpose of the flotilla is to make a political statement they are pointing out that the people of gaza are suffering a collective punishment a crime against humanity they are being punished for democratically electing in hamas without very brave ( fearless in my eyes as there is a very good chance that the brave brave israeli navy may shoot them dead ) people like the flotilla organisers and the participants we would hear next to nothing about gaza and the crimes that occur there on a daily basis they are protesting peacefully against a brutal regime gaza and the treatment of the palestinians is the world 's shame if you are one of these people that supports israeli actions against the people of gaza you should hang your head in shame the way that you paint israel as the victim and the people of gaza as the aggressors is breathtaking
4	wow , " gaza is a prison , you can visit the prisoners but you will have to do it through the warden " everybody should watch this this is israel 's foremost history professor explaining israel 's policy in the territories http www youtube com watch ? v uflaitmq3zi & t <>

4	yes , they were so trigger happy that they did absolutely nothing since the ships had n't sailed yet
1	israel is imposing their " shit fanatical religion " on the " entire world " haha , wow all i can say is if the average american is as dumb as you then america is royally fucked
4	aside from the fact that you 've proffered zero evidence of israelis seizing palestinian bound goods except as related to security considerations ( like weapons ) , your point is absurd after all , even if true , some of the aid would eventually reach the palestinians but , with a stunt like this , where next to no aid is on board , and you sail knowing that it cannot be delivered , you help nobody
6	what ? you do realize you 're just making up stupid conspiracy theories to fit into your delusional narrative right ? please show me evidence of israelis stealing aid from convoys going into gaza
2	israelis will take whatever they need or want from the load proof now
2	he said that israeli corporations have american daughter companies whatever they make ( mainly telco stuff ) , is labeled as " made in the usa " and is not covered by the statistics you cite
4	on june <> , an anonymous complaint was filed against the ship 's " seaworthiness " the israel law centre ( shurat hadin ) , took responsibility for the complaint in the israeli media it 's funny the israelis seem to vacillate between a profound concern for the health are welfare of the activists , and shooting them in the head
4	" you have , do , and will continue to buy israeli products " you sound like a stalker
1	glad to see you are sufficiently concerned to post the above paragraph good if you can avoid it dont buy israeli simple fuck them
1	thank fuck you live in perfectland
8	sorry mr hindsight but for one that was not racially motivated , it was monetarily motivated admittidly there should have been support , so to in the holocaust but that 's over now too our fellow humans need our help , regardless of the ' publicity stunts ' what 's going on is very much real
4	and i was promptly downvoted , the posts have been upvoted a bit now , but not much meanwhile , johnfpublics lying post was mindlessly upvoted and as for your assertion that most people ( on this subreddit ) are " generally good " note the upvoting of antisemitic statements , that occurs regularly on r worldnews collective punishment is immoral and illegal under international law sure the jewish religion and culture sees nothing wrong with it ( <> upvotes , <> downvotes ) i made a post about it on r shitredditsays which brought some downvotes , before that it was at <> <> i 've spent a bunch of time on r worldnews many of the people posting and upvoting in these threads are out pushing a racist ( not just antisemitic ) agenda it 's the same on r politics and r worldpolitics
4	seriously , it 's one thing to sympathize with the palestinian cause , but if you support any of the actions of the " humanitarian " flotilla you are either terribly misinformed or retardedly gullible thanks , jonnyclueless , for providing this discussion with some facts and a rational perspective , reddit often gets too caught up in tonguing it 's own collective asshole
4	i do but taking sides like this does not sound very moral to me
1	what the fuck are you on about ?
2	sure everyone hates jews there 's always a stereotype attached to jews in every culture that has encountered them greedy , filthy then you should stop bitching about jerusalem being your own promised land time will tell who 's going to kick your ass , either the turks or the someone else i will be watching from the sidelines and laughing at you
1	sigh my tax dollars hard at work first off to perpetuate the terrorism myth , second of all for israel to further fuck with their neighbors so they can take their shit fanatical religion and impose it upon the entire world god bless america , happy <> everyone , usa <> ! ! !
4	it 's like that time when that " unsinkable " " ship " hit that " iceberg "
2	first the irish came through , and now the greek , thank you , the hate mongering flotilla needs to stop , islamofascism is real
4	it kinda sounds like they wanna mess with tex
4	sounds like you are clueless , jonny
4	i do n't think the upvotes are clueless per se so far the list johnofpublic provided was the most accurate now your list is ( possibly ) more accurate and certainly more recent note that it comes from a single government source it would still be interesting to see an aggregate survey to see what actually comes through , on the ground the list of things that are not allowed into gaza indeed appears to have dropped somewhat there is still a lot of equipment that is not allowed into gaza , however it seems difficult to operate a viable economy there ( deriving from the list of goods incl wassenaar construction , mining , farming , industry , it are all restricted )
6	or a muslim state ( saudia arabia , iran , and countless others ) why exactly do the muslims get to claim their own states but not the jews ?
4	apparently there is unfortunately and the result is what you see on the evening news a racially religiously oriented colonial supremacist state will always be at war with its neighbors once it becomes a state of all its citizens , its troubles will end and jews , christians and muslims will be able to live once again in peace in the holy land like they did for hundreds of years
4	that 's funny because the un supervised the cargo from the last flotilla group would that be the flotilla group that had nine of its members murdered by the israelis , one of them a teen aged american ? as i recall , two idf soldiers were disarmed , held captive by flotilla members and let go alive after their compadres murdered the nine it 's pretty easy to see who the peacemakers are , eh what ?
4	you can keep calling it bigotry all you like , but you 'll still be full of shit
1	because the palestinians are waging war , not israel , dumbfuck , unilateral actions of israel have probably saved hundreds of thousands of palestinian lives
3	if this is based on some " zionist , " agenda , why do the egyptians fear terrorism equally and maintain the other checkpoint and specifically bar the terrorist govt of gaza from crossing when now no one else is barred by egypt , even under the revolution
2	jews have been hated since day one and as long as their cultural identity continues to exist the muslim world will always want them dead
4	file kati mirizi edw proti fora oi ellada kani kati tetoio greece has always been pro palestine and anti israel this is the first time something like this has happened someone else is behind this that the greek government is taking orders from
4	wtf are you talking about ? seriously , i have no idea the boycott is a joke , as is clear by the statistics of israel 's booming economy and next to nil unemployment numbers all i am saying , is that i find it funny how gullible people are , and how self important they feel when they say retarded idiotic and naive statements with such conviction like you for example
4	its shit like this ( http www bea gov papers pdf intrafirmtradejanuary04 pdf )
1	so they can take their shit fanatical religion and impose it upon the entire world the fuck ? ? ! what are you even talking about ? ? ?
6	why is israel blockading gaza ? because hamas uses ships to have missiles and weapons delivered from iran and use them to attack israeli civilians hamas does n't hide this fact and they state it in their charter why is israel so brutal ? that 's subjective , but the reason is because israel is under constant attack and the only way to prevent the violence to them from reaching the same levels it once was is to prevent the attackers from ever getting close enough to be able to do so it used to be that israel was being attacked from every neighboring country and this was before the disputes that are now being used as a justification for hamas attacks why do the palestinians fire rockets ? hamas has stated that it 's goal is to eliminate israel even long before hamas came about this was still often the case do you remember the " drive the jews into the sea " campaign ? originally everything east of the jordan was designated to the jews and everything west to the arabs , giving the arabs <> of what was then palestine but this was n't good enough so they attacked the jews this was long before any of the current disputes , so maybe you should ask why did they do that ? why is malnutrition rife in gaza ? because gaza 's government spends all of its resources on trying to attack israel instead of building its infrastructure when gaza was given back , israel left large infrastructures in tact for the people to use hamas destroyed it all because it was built by jews what are the palestinians upset about ? they are the only ones with legitimate gripes they are victims caught in a war being lead by hamas why has this dragged on for <> years because it 's based on religion and so long as people follow these religions , that will take priority over the good of the people hamas does n't simply want to exterminate jews because they are diabolical they believe they are doing the will of their god and trying to get back their holy land for their god whats israel doing in the west bank ? this is an area that i do n't agree with israel on however to be fair , this land was originally designated to them , not the palestnians it was taken from them by syria and technically belonged to syria not palestine ( which is n't a country ) originally when israel was attacked again they used the land as a buffer zone to protect them from the ongoing attacks having that buffer made it harder for syria to attack them however building on it negates that use which is where i disagree with them palestinians would get all the publicity they need if they would stop supporting hamas they would get more humanitarian aid than anyone in the world if it were not for hamas but because they choose a government who 's goal is war , most aid provided to them would just be used for attacking another group of people israel does n't fear attention going to palestinians israel would love for palestine to have everything israel has but so long as they choose war , israel has no choice but to protect itself
6	what will happen is that turkish ships will return home with their tails between their legs
4	the greeks deciding that a ship is not seaworthy ? wow , never thought i 'd see the day ( context grew up in a family that was heavily involved in oil shipping and got moved around a lot thanks to good ol' royal dutch )
6	but greece is being bailed out by the eu why does the us matter that much to them right now ?
4	it 's funny how you consider it a war crime when israel responds to hamas attacks yet you make no such argument about hamas launching these attacks from schools , hospitals , and using human shields a bit of a double standard no ? israel used precision guided weapons to take out strategic military targets that hamas intentionally put in populated areas , a direct violation of the geneva convention but that violation is not an issue to you , israel trying to stop those attacks is and what was hamas 's tactic ? to blindly fire rockets into civilian populations they did n't target military , they targeted civilians another breach of the geneva convention btw , the person who wrote the un report upon reading all of the facts changed his mind and concluded that israel was not guilty of war crimes , but only hamas was of course other members of the un do n't agree with the author , but they also share your position which is that israel commits war crimes when it takes out military targets that hamas intentionally puts behind human shields i would actually love to see someone come up with a reasonable response israel should have to the missile attacks one other than just letting their people get killed
3	secular palestinian terrorists
4	there was no murder the militia on the boat attacked the israeli soldiers if you recall , several idf soldiers were shot and stabbed several were thrown down decks the only reason they survived is because they switch to their last resort of using guns their biggest mistake was not expecting to have to use force , hence being equipped with flash bangs and rubber bullets but once it became clear that the militia on board had every intent of violence they had to defend themselves many of them were recorded as saying that they had all intentions of dying as martyrs on that ship they have stockpiles of weapons even as the idf were repelling down they were beating them to death and guess how much humanitarian supplies were on that boat zero all of that death could have easily been avoided they could have simply complied and let the cargo get inspected and it would have arrived and no one would have gotten hurt they could have also followed israel 's suggestion before they left port , which was to deliver the goods through egypt but they had no intention of delivering humanitarian supplies they wanted a fight , they chose to attack , and they are responsible for the deaths not the idf
1	right , i meant protocol i thank you for noticing that , i fucked up what i mean is that israel controls the borders of palestine not because of force but because of an international agreement between the representatives of both nations , which is the oslo peace accords , which states that israel should control the air above palestine and the territorial water outside of gaza so after that one would argue whether they control the territory of not , and if they do n't they could potentially have a sea blockade from the hauge convention occupied territory is territory which is under another nations military control as far as i know there 's two problems with this ( <> ) gaza , and palestine as a whole , is n't a recognized nation by most of the worlds nations or by the un , meaning most international laws does n't apply this is why pna needs to get their shit together and create a state ( <> ) you could of course also follow prior international law which states that the entire british mandate of palestine should be a jewish state and that jordan and pna are occupying israeli land what i meant with being difficult was that the gc was created for another type of warfare goldstone was claimed to be just and fair , and not possible to influence when he agreed with palestine , but is beeing pressured when he agrees with israel give it a break no , it is n't a criminal like punishment , putting them in prisons would be searching and denying them the right to make weapons mainly aimed at hurting soft targets however is legal and i have yet to see any evidence that they restrict anything simply because they are mean most of the things are either weapons , or have a dual purpose hardly illegal either way there 's a lot of debate as to whether you can or ca n't occupy something which is n't a state in itself , which prior international law says is your 's probably you ca n't and the uk only had the possibility to modify an agreement within the san remo agreement and not amend it you say they maintain the right to place soldiers in gaza why yes , they do it 's called self defense and most states agree they have the right to self defense , even through preemptive strikes ( like the us strikes into pakistani territory , but perhaps pakistan is occupied ) israel probably maintains control over the west bank , but not gaza not controlling gaza means the can issue a blockade could they excerice authority at will ? maybe , but probably not israel maintains the right to stop delivering electricity when attacked , since a power station would be something they could attack if palestine had been a state and had attacked them , i believe this to be withing reason
